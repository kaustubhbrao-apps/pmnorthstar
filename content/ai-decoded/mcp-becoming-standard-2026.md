  - question: "What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?"
    answer: "MCP is an open standard introduced by Anthropic in November 2024 that defines how AI applications connect to external tools and data sources. It standardizes the way LLM-powered tools (Claude Desktop, Cursor, IDEs) talk to data sources (databases, file systems, SaaS APIs, internal services). Without MCP, every AI tool needed custom integration with every other tool — an N×M problem. With MCP, it becomes N+M."
  - question: "Which AI tools support MCP?"
    answer: "As of mid-2026: Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline, Continue, Zed, Windsurf, the OpenAI Agents SDK, Google's Agentspace, Microsoft Copilot Studio, and a growing number of vertical AI tools. The list keeps expanding. Most production AI tools shipped or refactored to support MCP between mid-2025 and early 2026."
  - question: "Should my product have an MCP server?"
    answer: "If your product has an API and your users are building AI workflows, yes. An MCP server makes your product accessible to every AI agent that supports MCP — which is most of them by mid-2026. Without an MCP server, your product is invisible to the agent layer that's becoming the primary interaction surface for many users. It's roughly the equivalent of 'does your product have a REST API' in 2010."
  - question: "How hard is it to build an MCP server?"
    answer: "The minimum viable MCP server is a few hundred lines of TypeScript or Python that wraps your existing API. Anthropic provides SDKs in multiple languages, and there are well-documented example implementations for common patterns. The hardest part isn't the protocol itself; it's deciding which tools, prompts, and resources to expose, and how to handle authentication and authorization for agent-driven access. A first MCP server can be built in a day; a production-grade one takes a few weeks."
  - question: "Will MCP become a real standard or fade away?"
    answer: "The adoption trajectory strongly suggests it will stick. Anthropic open-sourced the protocol, OpenAI adopted it in the Agents SDK, Google and Microsoft are shipping support. The pattern looks like HTTP in the 1990s or REST in the 2000s — a standard that achieved escape velocity through cross-vendor adoption. The main risk is fragmentation if a competing standard (something from OpenAI or Google) emerges, but as of mid-2026 MCP is the de facto standard."

In November 2024, Anthropic published an open standard called Model Context Protocol — MCP for short. The press coverage was thin. Most of the discussion in AI Twitter centered on Claude's then-current capabilities rather than the protocol announcement. Eighteen months later, MCP has quietly become one of the most important pieces of infrastructure in the AI tools ecosystem. Every serious AI tool implements it. The protocol is on the path to becoming the de facto standard for how AI agents talk to external systems — the same way HTTP became the standard for the web.

For PMs and founders, MCP is something you should understand even if you don't directly build AI products. The reason: in 18 months, your product's accessibility to AI agents will be a meaningful share of how your product is used. If you have an MCP server, agents can drive workflows through your product. If you don't, you're invisible to that layer.

## What MCP actually is

The basic problem MCP solves: AI tools (Claude Desktop, Cursor, IDEs, agents) need to access external data and capabilities. They need to read your files, query your database, call your APIs, get the current weather, post to your Slack. Before MCP, every AI tool needed custom integrations with every external system. The combinatorics were brutal — 50 AI tools × 50 data sources = 2,500 custom integrations to build and maintain.

MCP standardizes the interface. AI tools speak MCP. Data sources expose MCP servers. The two sides agree on a protocol for how requests, responses, errors, and streaming work. The 2,500 integration problem becomes 100 — each AI tool implements MCP once, each data source implements MCP once, and any combination works.

The protocol defines three core primitives:

**Resources**: data sources the AI can read. A file system, a database table, a SaaS account, a sensor stream. The AI can list available resources and read specific ones.

**Tools**: functions the AI can execute. "Send an email," "create a calendar event," "post to Slack," "deploy this code." Tools have typed inputs and outputs.

**Prompts**: pre-defined prompt templates that the host application (the AI tool) can offer to users. Lets server authors guide how their data should be used.

The protocol is JSON-RPC over various transports (stdio, HTTP, WebSocket). Implementation is reasonably straightforward in any modern language. Anthropic provides SDKs in TypeScript, Python, Go, and others.

## Why adoption took off

Three structural reasons MCP succeeded where previous "standardize AI" attempts failed.

**Anthropic open-sourced it from day one.** The protocol specification, the SDKs, the example servers — all open. This eliminated the "single-vendor lock-in" concern that killed several earlier AI standardization attempts. Any company can implement MCP without depending on Anthropic's infrastructure or business model.

**OpenAI adopted it.** The single most important moment in MCP's adoption arc was when OpenAI's Agents SDK shipped with MCP support in early 2025. Up until that point, MCP could plausibly have been a "Claude-only" standard. The OpenAI adoption signaled that this was a real cross-vendor protocol, which made every other AI tool company more comfortable investing in it.

**It actually solved a real pain point.** Engineers building AI tools were spending real effort on custom integrations. MCP let them shift that effort to the protocol layer, which was a clear productivity win. Standards don't succeed because they're well-designed; they succeed because they solve a problem that enough people have at the same time. MCP arrived exactly when the integration problem was becoming acute for AI tool builders.

## What having an MCP server does for your product

Three concrete benefits.

**Agent visibility.** When a user runs an AI agent that needs to do something your product handles, the agent can discover your MCP server, learn what it does, and use it. Without MCP, the agent can't see your product as a tool. With MCP, you're in the catalog.

**Workflow integration without you building integrations.** Today, integrating with N partner products requires N custom integrations on your side. With MCP, you build one MCP server and it works with every AI tool that supports MCP. The leverage compounds as more AI tools support MCP.

**Defensive positioning.** As more business workflows move through AI agents, products without MCP support become functionally invisible to those workflows. Your competitors with MCP servers will win the agent-driven use cases by default. The competitive cost of not having MCP rises every quarter.

## What an MCP server looks like

For your product, an MCP server typically wraps your existing API. The server runs as a small process (or as a hosted service) that translates between the MCP protocol and your internal APIs.

A minimum viable MCP server exposes:

- A few key resources (the most commonly accessed data in your product)
- A handful of tools (the most useful actions your product can perform)
- Authentication that handles agent-driven access (typically OAuth with agent-specific scopes)

The implementation is a few hundred lines of code in TypeScript or Python. You can build a first version in a day. The harder questions are around what to expose:

**Authentication and authorization.** Agents acting on behalf of users need scoped access. You can't give an agent the same access as a logged-in human; you need an explicit consent model and granular permissions. The standards here are still evolving.

**Rate limiting and abuse.** Agents can hit your API far harder than human users. You need rate limits, anomaly detection, and the ability to revoke agent access without affecting human users.

**Cost allocation.** Agent-driven API usage can be costly. Some products are introducing usage-based pricing tiers specifically for agent traffic, separately from human user pricing.

**Audit trails.** When an agent does something on a user's behalf, you need a clear record. Was the action authorized? Was the agent acting on the user's explicit request or on its own judgment? Compliance teams will want answers.

## What's still rough

MCP is not done. Several gaps remain.

**Discovery.** Today, finding MCP servers is mostly manual. The user (or the AI tool) needs to know that your server exists and how to connect to it. There's no equivalent of DNS for MCP yet. Anthropic and others are working on this; in the meantime, MCP server directories are emerging as a temporary solution.

**Authentication standards.** OAuth flows for agent-driven access are not yet standardized in MCP itself. Each server implements its own approach. This is an obvious gap; expect a standard to emerge in the next 12-18 months.

**Streaming.** Long-running operations (a query that takes 30 seconds, an action that involves human-in-the-loop confirmation) don't have well-established patterns in MCP yet. The protocol supports streaming, but the conventions are still being figured out.

**Multi-server coordination.** When an agent needs to use multiple MCP servers in a coordinated workflow (read from Server A, write to Server B), the orchestration is up to the AI tool. There's no MCP-level mechanism for transactions, rollbacks, or distributed coordination.

These gaps are real but solvable. None of them are blocking adoption; they're slowing the maturity of the most demanding use cases.

## What competing standards exist

The honest answer: not many serious ones, and the trajectory favors MCP.

OpenAI's Agents SDK includes MCP support; OpenAI has not (as of mid-2026) pushed a competing protocol. Google's Agentspace and Vertex AI agent products both support MCP. Microsoft's Copilot Studio supports MCP for third-party integrations. The vendor consensus is unusual for a young standard.

There are some narrower standards in adjacent spaces. OpenAI's Function Calling format is a model-level concern, not a protocol; it doesn't compete with MCP directly. Google's protocol buffers and gRPC remain dominant for internal RPC but aren't AI-agent-specific.

The most plausible competing scenario is fragmentation rather than displacement. A vertical-specific protocol could emerge for, say, e-commerce agents (UCP, which Google announced) without displacing MCP for general agentic workflows. That's the world we may be heading toward: MCP as the general standard, with vertical protocols layered on for specific transactional categories.

## What every PM should do

Three concrete actions.

**Audit whether your product needs an MCP server.** If your product has an API and your users are building AI workflows, the answer is probably yes. If you're not sure, look at whether competitors in your category are shipping MCP support. By mid-2026, most B2B SaaS products in active development have MCP servers in their roadmap.

**Allocate engineering for MCP support, not as a side project.** The first MCP server is a day of work. The production-grade version is a few weeks. The ongoing maintenance is real — every model and every AI tool update can affect agent behavior against your server. Treat MCP as a permanent surface, like your REST API, not a one-off integration.

**Watch the standards evolve.** The protocol is moving fast. Authentication patterns, multi-server orchestration, agent-specific pricing models are all being figured out in real time. Joining the MCP community on GitHub (the spec repo) is the easiest way to stay current. Decisions made now in the protocol will shape the AI agent ecosystem for the next decade.

MCP isn't glamorous. It's plumbing. But every successful technology layer eventually depends on plumbing, and the companies that invested in plumbing early (RESTful APIs in 2008, mobile-responsive sites in 2012, GraphQL in 2018) tended to compound advantages over time. MCP is the AI agent equivalent. Your product should be on it.
