faqs:
  - question: "What is Google Antigravity?"
    answer: "Antigravity is Google's AI-native developer platform, launched in late 2025 and updated to v2 in 2026. It combines an IDE-like environment, Gemini-powered coding agents, deep integration with Google Cloud and Vertex AI, and an end-to-end workflow from prompt to deployed application. The v2 release shifts the product from 'interesting beta' to 'real competitor to Cursor for enterprise teams.'"
  - question: "Antigravity vs Cursor — which is better?"
    answer: "Different audiences. Cursor remains the default for startup engineers and indie developers because of its model-agnostic approach and faster iteration speed. Antigravity 2 is meaningfully better for teams already invested in Google Cloud — the deployment, observability, and IAM integration are first-class in ways Cursor can't match. For enterprises standardizing on Google Cloud, Antigravity 2 is the right pick; for everyone else, Cursor is still the default."
  - question: "Does Antigravity support models other than Gemini?"
    answer: "v2 added limited support for Claude and GPT-5 through bring-your-own-API-key, but the deepest integration remains with Gemini. The product's most differentiated features (agent orchestration, Vertex integration, deployment workflows) are Gemini-first. Engineers who want true model-agnosticism are still better served by Cursor."
  - question: "Is Antigravity available to individual developers?"
    answer: "Yes, with a free tier limited by usage quotas. Paid tiers start at $25/user/month and include increased Gemini quota and access to the agent orchestration features. Enterprise pricing scales based on Vertex AI usage. The product is most cost-effective for teams that are already paying for Google Cloud."
  - question: "What's the bear case for Antigravity?"
    answer: "Three risks. (1) Google has historically struggled to ship developer products at Cursor's pace; the institutional weight that hurt GitHub Copilot's response to Cursor could equally hurt Antigravity. (2) The tight Gemini coupling cuts both ways — when Gemini is the right model for a task, Antigravity wins; when Claude or GPT-5 is better, Antigravity loses. (3) Developer tools rarely win on incumbent strength alone; community and mindshare matter, and Cursor has a head start that Google has to overcome through product superiority, not Google's brand."

Google's Antigravity launched in late 2025 with limited fanfare. The product was clearly ambitious — Google's answer to Cursor, Claude Code, and the broader AI-native IDE category — but the v1 release was rough enough that most engineers tried it once and moved on. The v2 release in mid-2026 is a different story. Antigravity 2 is the first AI coding platform from Big Tech that's good enough to actually compete with Cursor on its own terms, and for enterprises already standardized on Google Cloud, it might be the right default.

This is a useful moment to look at what Antigravity 2 actually is, what Google got right in the v2 turnaround, what's still rough, and what the existence of a credible Big Tech competitor means for the AI coding tools market.

## What Antigravity 2 actually is

Antigravity is not just an IDE. It's a vertically integrated developer platform with several layers:

**The editor surface.** An IDE-like environment that runs in the browser or as a desktop app, with code editing, chat, file navigation, and terminal. Comparable to Cursor's editor at a baseline; meaningfully behind on small details that matter to power users (keyboard shortcut depth, extension ecosystem, multi-cursor workflows).

**Gemini-powered coding agents.** The default model is Gemini 2.5 Pro, with Gemini Code variants tuned specifically for coding tasks. The agent orchestration is where Google has invested most — Antigravity can decompose a complex task into sub-tasks, run them in parallel, and merge the results. This is more sophisticated than what Cursor's Composer mode does for multi-file edits.

**Deep Google Cloud integration.** This is the differentiated layer. Antigravity knows about your Google Cloud projects, your IAM permissions, your Cloud Build configurations, your Cloud Run services. You can ask the agent to deploy a service, configure a database, set up monitoring — and the agent handles the GCP-specific complexity natively. No equivalent in Cursor without manual setup.

**Vertex AI workflows.** For teams already using Vertex AI for ML/AI workflows, Antigravity integrates the model training, evaluation, and deployment loop. You can prompt the agent to fine-tune a model on Vertex, deploy it as an endpoint, and wire it into your application — without leaving the IDE.

**Observability and deployment.** Errors in production code can be surfaced directly in the editor through Cloud Operations integration. The agent can read live logs, identify the failure pattern, and propose a fix. This closes the loop from "production error" to "deployed fix" in a way standalone IDEs cannot match.

The v2 release added significant improvements: better latency on Gemini responses, deeper IAM-aware operations, multi-environment workflows (dev/staging/prod with proper isolation), and a much-improved chat interface that matches what users expect after two years of Cursor and Claude Desktop UX iteration.

## What Google got right in v2

The v1 release felt like a tech demo with a thin product wrapper. The v2 release feels like a real product. Three things changed.

**Product leadership shift.** Anecdotally (Google hasn't confirmed publicly), the Antigravity product team in 2026 includes leaders with deep IDE experience. The v2 UI shows it — the small UX decisions that distinguish good IDEs from mediocre ones are noticeably better.

**Faster shipping cadence.** v1 to v2 shipped in roughly nine months, which is slow by Cursor standards but fast by Big Tech standards. Google has clearly been investing in releasing more frequent capability updates between major versions. The patch cadence in 2026 is much closer to Cursor's pace than GitHub Copilot's.

**Bringing in third-party models.** The v2 addition of Claude and GPT-5 support through bring-your-own-API-key is a tacit acknowledgment that Gemini isn't always the right model. The integration is deliberately less polished than Gemini integration (the agent orchestration features are Gemini-first), but the existence of the option matters. It signals that Google is willing to be pragmatic about model choice in ways the GitHub Copilot/OpenAI relationship doesn't allow.

## What's still rough

Three areas where Antigravity 2 is behind Cursor.

**Speed of iteration.** Cursor ships meaningful improvements every few weeks. Antigravity 2's release cadence is closer to every few months. For a category moving as fast as AI coding tools, the iteration speed difference accumulates. By the time Antigravity ships a feature, Cursor has often shipped it months earlier.

**Community and ecosystem.** Cursor has a thriving extension ecosystem, an active community, well-known shortcuts and conventions. Antigravity has Google's brand but not the bottoms-up developer community that makes a tool feel alive. The community gap is the hardest one to close because it's a function of years of accumulation, not feature parity.

**Model agnosticism in agentic workflows.** The Claude/GPT-5 support in v2 is real but limited. The Antigravity agent orchestration features assume Gemini's specific capabilities. If you want to drive a complex agent workflow using Claude, you're better off in Cursor or Claude Code. Antigravity is structurally a Gemini-first product, regardless of what BYOK options it offers.

## Who should actually use Antigravity 2

The honest answer:

**Use Antigravity 2 if:** Your team is heavily invested in Google Cloud. You're running real ML workloads on Vertex AI. You value the IAM-aware operations and deployment integration. Your developers are comfortable with Gemini as the primary model and don't need fine-grained model choice on every task.

**Stick with Cursor if:** Your team uses AWS or Azure as primary cloud. You're a startup or indie developer who values model flexibility (Claude for some tasks, GPT-5 for others). Your engineering culture moves fast and you need a tool that ships features at startup speed. You care about VS Code extension compatibility (Cursor's fork is a strict superset; Antigravity is a separate IDE).

**Consider Claude Code if:** You're a power user who prefers terminal-first workflows. You're building agentic workflows that need to run unattended. You want maximum control with maximum AI leverage and don't need a polished IDE chrome.

**Stay on GitHub Copilot if:** Your team has standardized on the Microsoft ecosystem (Azure, Visual Studio, Teams). You need enterprise sales / compliance / procurement features that smaller AI coding tools can't match. You're primarily using AI for autocomplete rather than agent-driven workflows.

The four tools are not interchangeable. The choice matters and is increasingly hard to reverse once a team has built workflows around one of them.

## What Antigravity 2 means for the AI coding tools market

Three observations.

**Big Tech can ship credible AI coding tools.** The narrative that GitHub Copilot's failure to keep up with Cursor proved Big Tech couldn't compete in this category was always overstated. Antigravity 2 shows that with focused execution, Big Tech can ship products that compete on capability. The execution is the variable, not the resources.

**Cloud lock-in is a real moat in AI coding tools.** Antigravity 2's differentiated advantage is its tight integration with Google Cloud. The same dynamic could play out for Microsoft (Azure-tight Copilot) and AWS (if they ever ship a serious AI coding tool). The teams that picked their cloud provider years ago are increasingly being pulled toward that provider's AI coding tools, not because the tools are universally better, but because the integration cost is lower.

**The model layer is consolidating into vendor camps.** Anthropic has Claude Code. OpenAI has the Operator/Agents SDK ecosystem. Google has Antigravity. The pattern of each frontier model lab building (or acquiring) their own coding tool layer is now clear. The model-agnostic third-party tools like Cursor are the alternative to this consolidation, but they have to keep proving they can stay ahead of any one vertical stack on features.

For PMs and founders building anything in the AI coding tools space, Antigravity 2 is a signal worth taking seriously. The window for small teams to build differentiated AI coding tools is narrowing as the model labs vertically integrate. Cursor's lead is real but not unassailable. The next 18 months will determine whether the AI coding tools category settles into a multi-vendor equilibrium (Cursor + Antigravity + Claude Code + others) or whether one vertical stack achieves dominance.

For individual engineers, Antigravity 2 is worth a 30-minute look if you work in Google Cloud, and probably skippable otherwise. The product is good enough to be a real option for the right audience but not so transformative that it deserves to displace your existing workflow if you're already happy with what you're using.

The category is more interesting in 2026 than it was in 2024. That's a good thing for users and a difficult thing for any single tool's long-term moat.
