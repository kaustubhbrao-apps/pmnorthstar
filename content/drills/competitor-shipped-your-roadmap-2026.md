  When a competitor ships the feature you've been planning, the right
  move is almost never "ship faster." It's "ask what their version
  is missing that yours has to add." Speed alone doesn't differentiate;
  a better understanding of the user does.
intro: |
  You are the head of product at a Series-B AI-powered hiring
  platform. Your team has spent six months designing an "AI candidate
  screener" — an agent that conducts the first round of interviews
  asynchronously, summarizes them, and ranks candidates for human
  recruiters. Beta launch in 8 weeks. Investors are excited.

  This morning, your closest competitor (similar funding, smaller team,
  faster reputation) shipped exactly that feature in public beta. The
  Twitter response is lukewarm — early users complain about hallucinated
  summaries and stiff conversation flow — but the product manager who
  built it just published a 4,000-word post about their roadmap.

  Your CEO is in your office.
nodes:
  start:
    dimension: founder
    prompt: |
      The next 24 hours matter. Pick the move.
    options:
      - text: Accelerate. Get our version shipped in 2 weeks instead of 8. Beat them to enterprise.
        points: 1
        pattern: speed-as-strategy
        rationale: |
          The instinct to outpace. Problem: shipping in 2 weeks means
          cutting the parts that would have made your version better.
          You'd ship a near-identical product to theirs, with the same
          hallucination issues, into a market that's just been
          disappointed by the same shape of product. Speed without
          differentiation just confirms the customer's belief that the
          category isn't ready.
        consequence: |
          You ship in 3 weeks (the 2-week timeline slipped). Reception
          is similarly lukewarm. Press writes "another AI screener
          ships." You spend Q3 firefighting the same bugs your
          competitor is fixing.
        leadsTo: end-A
      - text: Kill the feature. Pivot the team to a different problem on the roadmap.
        points: 2
        pattern: capitulate-on-real-bet
        rationale: |
          Overcorrects. You're abandoning six months of design work
          because someone shipped first, not because the user need
          went away. If the bet was correct (and your six-month
          discovery should tell you), the bet is still correct —
          you just have to ship a meaningfully better version.
          Killing the feature signals to the team that being first
          matters more than being right.
        consequence: |
          The team is demoralized. Engineering loses two weeks
          to context-switching. Your competitor's product gets
          better in Q3 and they take the category.
        leadsTo: end-B
      - text: Ship on time. Use the competitor's launch as research. Differentiate on what they got wrong.
        points: 5
        pattern: opponent-as-research
        rationale: |
          The right move. Their beta is your most expensive piece of
          user research, paid for by them. The Twitter complaints
          (hallucination, stiff flow) tell you exactly where to
          invest the next 8 weeks. Their roadmap post tells you what
          they think comes next — you can pick the gap. You ship
          on time but with a meaningfully better product that
          earns the conversion from their early customers.
        consequence: |
          Eight weeks later you ship with two specific improvements
          targeted at their failure modes: human-verified summaries
          and adaptive flow. Three of their unhappy customers switch
          to you in the first month.
        leadsTo: C-differentiate-followup
      - text: Announce immediately that you're shipping. Get ahead of the narrative.
        points: 3
        pattern: announce-without-ship
        rationale: |
          Marketing-first thinking. You can claim the category by
          announcing now, but if the product takes 8 weeks and isn't
          differentiated, the announcement just amplifies their
          launch (because the comparison is forced). Pre-announcements
          work when you have a real differentiator to anchor on; not
          when you're announcing parity.
        consequence: |
          The announcement gets coverage but coverage becomes
          comparison. By the time you ship, every review is "vs.
          [competitor]" and you're stuck on their narrative.
        leadsTo: end-D
  C-differentiate-followup:
    dimension: product
    prompt: |
      Eight weeks in. You've narrowed the differentiation to two
      candidates: (a) human-in-the-loop verification — every AI
      summary is checked by a recruiter before going to the hiring
      manager — or (b) candidate-side transparency — the candidate
      can see exactly what the AI scored them on and rebut anything.
      Pick the wedge.
    options:
      - text: 'Human-in-the-loop verification. Pitch to enterprise hiring teams: ''AI screener with a real check.'''
        points: 4
        pattern: enterprise-trust-wedge
        rationale: |
          Strong B2B angle. Enterprise hiring teams are scared of
          AI hallucination because it creates legal exposure. Your
          verification step removes that risk and gives them a
          defensible story. The tradeoff: it slows the product down
          and adds recruiter cost — your competitor is faster and
          cheaper on paper.
        consequence: |
          Enterprise deals close. You become "the safe AI screener."
          Mid-market customers who care about speed pick the
          competitor; you concede that segment.
        leadsTo: end-C-good
      - text: 'Candidate-side transparency. Pitch to candidates: ''finally, an AI interview that explains itself.'''
        points: 5
        pattern: two-sided-marketplace-move
        rationale: |
          The asymmetric play. Your competitor is selling to hiring
          managers; you're selling to candidates too. Candidates
          who hate AI screeners (most of them) become your
          advocates, and pressure their employers to switch. The
          two-sided market dynamic means recruiters who use your
          product also become candidates somewhere else and
          recommend you. Flywheel.
        consequence: |
          A candidate-side review goes viral on LinkedIn. Three of
          your competitor's enterprise customers ask for a demo
          after their recruiting candidates complain. You shift
          the category narrative from "AI for hiring teams" to
          "AI for both sides of hiring."
        leadsTo: end-C-great
      - text: Both. Build verification and transparency in parallel.
        points: 2
        pattern: hedging-loses-focus
        rationale: |
          The "do everything" trap. Building two distinct
          differentiators in parallel means neither lands fully and
          your launch messaging gets muddy. At this stage, one
          clearly-pitched wedge converts ten times better than two
          half-pitched ones.
        consequence: |
          Launch lands with split messaging. Neither audience knows
          which one you're for. You spend Q4 sharpening the pitch
          and giving up the wedge moment.
        leadsTo: end-C-mixed
  end-A:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      Speed without substance. You shipped a similar product to a
      similar market and the press called it parity. The category
      eventually got captured by the competitor that learned faster,
      not the one that shipped faster.
  end-B:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      The team lost momentum and the competitor took the category.
      You spent the next quarter explaining to your board why six
      months of work was abandoned.
  end-C-good:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      The enterprise-trust wedge worked. You own the safety
      conversation, your competitor owns speed. Stable two-player
      market for the next 18 months.
  end-C-great:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      The two-sided positioning rewrote the category. Candidate
      preference forced enterprise switching. You became the
      default in 24 months.
  end-C-mixed:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      The hedge muddled the launch. Sharper messaging eventually
      arrived, but you gave up the wedge moment to focus split.
  end-D:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      The pre-announcement amplified the competitor's launch. By
      ship date, you were the second product in a category they
      defined.

## What's at stake here

The pattern: in any high-velocity software category, **the second
shipper has more information than the first.** First-shippers are
fighting their own onboarding bugs, their own positioning gaps, and
their own user research at the same time. Second-shippers can pick
the specific gap the first version exposed and ship a meaningfully
better v1.

Examples from history: Slack wasn't the first team chat. Notion
wasn't the first all-in-one workspace. Stripe wasn't the first
payment API. In each case, the second-shipper used the first
product as research and shipped the better version.

Speed-as-strategy is the wrong reflex. **Learning-as-strategy** is
the right one.
