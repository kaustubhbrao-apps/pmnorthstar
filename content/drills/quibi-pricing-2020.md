principle: |
  A premium price requires a premium use case. If your product
  doesn't have a clear "why now and why this" moment for the user,
  charging more than alternatives is a moat-killer, not a moat-builder.
intro: |
  You are the head of growth at a new streaming startup. The product:
  ~10-minute "quick bites" of premium-quality video content
  (scripted shows, Hollywood production values, A-list stars),
  designed exclusively for mobile-vertical viewing during commute
  moments. You have $1.75B in raised capital and 50+ shows in the
  pipeline.

  Two pricing decisions on the table:
  1. Subscription price: $4.99/month with ads or $7.99 ad-free
  2. Distribution: mobile-only, or also TV/web?

  Launch is in 90 days. Netflix is $13/mo, Disney+ is $7/mo, HBO Max
  is $15/mo, YouTube is free. The pandemic has just hit; commute time
  has dropped to near-zero.

    prompt: |
      You have launch terms to set. Pick.
    options:
      - text: 'Launch as planned: $4.99 with ads, $7.99 ad-free, mobile-only, premium short-form.'
        points: 1
        pattern: ignore-market-shift
        rationale: |
          Ignores the most important fact: commute time has just
          collapsed. The entire product thesis ("watch on your
          phone during your commute") just lost its primary use
          case. Pushing through with the original plan optimizes
          for a launch you'd planned for a world that no longer
          exists.
        consequence: |
          Launch lands with strong press but lukewarm retention.
          Users sign up out of curiosity, find no time-of-day
          when the product fits, and churn within 30 days.
          Six months in, the product shuts down.
        leadsTo: end-A
      - text: Postpone launch by 6 months. Reposition for a post-pandemic moment when commute returns.
        points: 4
        pattern: wait-for-the-thesis-to-return
        rationale: |
          Defensible patience. Your thesis depends on commute
          existing; commute will return. Postponing buys you
          time to also expand to web/TV without rushing the
          launch. Risk: 6 months of paying the team and content
          producers without revenue, and the cultural moment
          might pass.
        consequence: |
          You postpone. Six months later, commute returns
          partially. Launch is more measured, retention slightly
          better. But the cultural buzz has dissipated; the
          launch is solid not breakout.
        leadsTo: end-B-postpone
      - text: 'Pivot positioning: drop the ''mobile-only commute'' frame. Make it ''premium short-form for any device.'''
        points: 5
        pattern: reposition-product
        rationale: |
          Right adaptive call. The content asset (premium 10-minute
          shows) is real and valuable; the distribution constraint
          (mobile-vertical, commute moments) is a marketing
          decision that turned out to be wrong for this moment.
          Repositioning preserves the content investment while
          adapting to the world that exists.
        consequence: |
          You ship web, TV apps, and mobile in parallel. The
          marketing pivots to "10-minute premium shows for any
          break." Retention improves materially. The product
          finds a real audience even if smaller than projected.
        leadsTo: C-reposition-followup
      - text: Drop the price to $2.99 with ads. Compete with TikTok and YouTube for attention.
        points: 1
        pattern: race-to-the-bottom
        rationale: |
          Wrong axis. Your content costs are $100K+/episode
          (premium production); free/ad-supported platforms have
          near-zero content costs. You can't win on price against
          TikTok, and the lower price signals to premium viewers
          that the product is downscale. You burn capital subsidizing
          a price war you can't win.
        consequence: |
          Subscriber count grows but ARPU collapses. Burn rate
          accelerates. Content quality slips as budgets get
          cut. Shutdown comes faster than the original plan
          would have produced.
        leadsTo: end-D
  C-reposition-followup:
    dimension: product
    prompt: |
      Repositioned to "premium short-form for any device." Web + TV
      apps shipped. Six months in, ARR is real but smaller than
      projected. A new content question: continue investing in
      premium 10-minute originals, or pivot to user-generated /
      lower-cost content?
    options:
      - text: Stay premium. The differentiation is the production value.
        points: 4
        pattern: premium-or-nothing
        rationale: |
          Right call. Going downstream on content quality erases
          the only differentiation from free alternatives. The
          smaller audience that values premium short-form is
          willing to pay; that's the business. Trying to be
          "Netflix for short-form" by competing on volume
          dilutes the value proposition.
        consequence: |
          You stay premium. Subscriber growth is steady but
          slow. ARPU is high. The product reaches sustainability
          in 18 months as a smaller-but-profitable niche.
        leadsTo: end-C-good
      - text: Add a creator-tier. Open the platform to creators making 10-minute premium content.
        points: 5
        pattern: marketplace-as-flywheel
        rationale: |
          Best long-term move. Studio content alone scales linearly
          with budget; a creator marketplace compounds. Curated
          creators producing 10-minute premium content (much
          lower cost than studio production) extend the catalog
          dramatically. The brand stays premium because of
          curation gates.
        consequence: |
          Creator-tier launches in 6 months. Catalog grows 10x in
          a year. The platform becomes the home for premium
          short-form creators. Subscriber growth accelerates.
        leadsTo: end-C-great
  end-A:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      The original launch ignored the pandemic context entirely.
      Users couldn't find a moment for the product. Retention
      collapsed and the company shut down 6 months in, returning
      ~$350M to shareholders out of $1.75B raised.
  end-B-postpone:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      Postponement preserved capital but lost the cultural moment.
      The eventual launch worked technically but never reached
      breakout. The company existed but didn't compound.
  end-C-good:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      Repositioning + premium discipline produced a sustainable
      niche. Smaller than projected, profitable, brand-clean.
      The company existed for years as a profitable specialty
      service.
  end-C-great:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      The marketplace flywheel changed the company's trajectory.
      The platform became the leading destination for premium
      short-form content. Series E closed at a strong valuation;
      the brand was eventually acquired at a multibillion-dollar
      price.
  end-D:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      Racing to the bottom on price accelerated the shutdown.
      Subscribers grew but the unit economics never worked. The
      company closed 4 months earlier than the original-plan
      scenario.

## What actually happened

This drill is based on **Quibi's launch in April 2020**. Jeffrey
Katzenberg and Meg Whitman raised **$1.75B** to launch a premium
short-form mobile video service. The pricing was $4.99 with ads or
$7.99 ad-free, mobile-vertical only.

The pandemic launched simultaneously, killing the commute use case
the entire product thesis depended on. Quibi did not reposition,
did not expand to TV/web on launch, and did not adapt the content
strategy to the new context. The product shut down in **October
2020**, six months after launch, returning ~$350M to shareholders
out of the $1.75B raised — one of the largest VC-backed shutdowns
in entertainment history.

The lesson: premium pricing requires a premium use case. When the
use case disappears (or never existed strongly), the price becomes
the moat-killer, not the moat-builder.
