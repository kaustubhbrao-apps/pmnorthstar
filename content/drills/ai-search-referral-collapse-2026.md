  When the distribution channel that built you starts shrinking, the
  question isn't "how do we keep extracting from it" — it's "what asset
  did we build inside this channel that's transferable to the next one."
  Audiences are transferable, traffic is not.
intro: |
  You're the founder of a 4-year-old B2B SaaS content site. ~$2M ARR.
  90% of your pipeline traditionally came from Google organic search —
  long-form articles, comparison pages, glossary content. You have ~400
  pages indexed, most of them ranking page-1 for high-intent queries.

  Over the last 6 months, Google AI Overviews + Perplexity + ChatGPT
  search have steadily eaten your top-of-funnel. Specific keyword
  rankings haven't moved much, but click-through rates have collapsed
  — AI engines answer directly without sending clicks. Organic
  pipeline is down 45% YoY. Paid conversion has held but CAC is
  rising. Your CFO wants a plan by Friday.
nodes:
  start:
    dimension: business
    prompt: |
      Pipeline is down 45%. Pick the move.
    options:
      - text: 'Rebuild for AI search: structured data, citation-ready content, llms.txt, FAQ schema across the 400 pages.'
        points: 12
        pattern: rebuild-for-the-new-channel
        rationale: |
          The defensible adaptation. AI engines preferentially cite content
          with clean structure, declared author E-E-A-T, and citation-
          ready formatting. Rebuilding the 400 pages over 8-12 weeks
          repositions you to be the source AI cites. Cost: real engineering
          and content work. Upside: AI-citation traffic compounds as more
          users move to AI search.
        consequence: |
          You ship the rebuild in 10 weeks. AI-driven mentions go from 8%
          to 24% of pipeline by Q4. Organic search keeps shrinking but
          AI citation grows enough to flatten the net.
        leadsTo: A-rebuild-followup
      - text: Convert the audience into a newsletter. Email is a channel you own, search is one you rent.
        points: 15
        pattern: own-the-distribution
        rationale: |
          The structural fix. Search traffic is rented from Google; email
          subscribers are owned. Convert the highest-intent ~5% of
          current visitors into newsletter readers, and the channel
          shift becomes a redistribution problem, not a survival problem.
          Email also enables monetization beyond inbound (sponsorships,
          paid tiers, courses) that search-driven sites can't access.
        consequence: |
          You ship a newsletter capture flow within 2 weeks. Subscribers
          grow from 4K to 28K in 6 months. The newsletter generates
          ~$200K ARR from sponsorships within the first year, fully
          replacing the lost search revenue.
        leadsTo: B-newsletter-followup
      - text: 'Double down on paid: aggressive Google Ads + LinkedIn to compensate for lost organic.'
        points: 3
        pattern: pay-for-shrinking-channel
        rationale: |
          The worst combination — paying for what used to be free on a
          channel that's being restructured. Paid CACs on AI-Overview-
          affected keywords are 40-60% higher than 18 months ago because
          fewer impressions go to ads. You're paying premium prices for
          declining attention with worse unit economics.
        consequence: |
          Paid CAC jumps another 30%. Pipeline stabilizes but margin
          collapses. The board notices the burn rate. Layoffs come in Q4.
        leadsTo: end-C
      - text: Build a product. Pivot from content business to software business. Use the audience to seed product launch.
        points: 9
        pattern: pivot-content-to-product
        rationale: |
          Bold but high-risk. Content businesses with strong audiences
          have built successful product businesses (Stratechery, Lenny's,
          MKBHD's Studio). But the execution is operationally different:
          you're now competing in software not in editorial. Without a
          product-side co-founder or strong PM hire, the pivot tends to
          fail. Right move if you have the team; wrong if you're
          improvising.
        consequence: |
          You spend 9 months building the product. It ships to mixed
          reception. The content business decays in parallel because
          attention split. Outcome depends entirely on product quality
          you can't yet judge.
        leadsTo: end-D
  A-rebuild-followup:
    dimension: product
    prompt: |
      The rebuild is mid-flight. ~150 pages restructured. AI citations
      are starting to show up. A new question: should you publish an
      annual industry benchmark / dataset to become the definitive
      citation source for your category?
    options:
      - text: Yes. Publish the benchmark, make it free + downloadable, structure for citation.
        points: 15
        pattern: citation-magnet
        rationale: |
          Asymmetric long-term play. A well-executed industry benchmark
          becomes the citation source for every AI search query in your
          category for years. One-time research + publication cost,
          compounding citations across every AI model. Cheaper per
          impression than 400 SEO pages.
        consequence: |
          The benchmark publishes in November. Within 90 days it's cited
          by Perplexity, ChatGPT, and Claude for the top 8 queries in
          your category. AI-driven pipeline doubles. The benchmark
          becomes the company's most-quoted asset.
        leadsTo: end-A-great
      - text: Stick to the page rebuild. Don't over-invest in any single asset.
        points: 9
        pattern: incremental-only
        rationale: |
          Defensible discipline. Marginal pages add steady value but don't
          compound the way a definitive benchmark does. You'd get steady
          gains without the breakout asset.
        consequence: |
          Steady gains on AI search but no breakout moment. The
          competitor who published a benchmark captures the
          category citation share you could have had.
        leadsTo: end-A-good
  B-newsletter-followup:
    dimension: business
    prompt: |
      28K subscribers, 6 months in. Open rates ~38%, click rates ~9%.
      You can monetize three ways. Pick the path.
    options:
      - text: Free newsletter + paid 'pro' tier with deep analysis ($15/mo). Build a Substack-style subscription business.
        points: 15
        pattern: free-plus-paid-tiers
        rationale: |
          The canonical content business model. Free tier maximizes
          subscriber growth and ad/sponsorship revenue; paid tier
          captures willingness-to-pay from the highest-engagement
          subscribers. Both tiers reinforce each other — free promotes
          paid, paid funds the writing that powers free.
        consequence: |
          Pro tier launches with 4% conversion. ~1,100 paying subscribers
          at $15 = $200K ARR. Free tier keeps growing through the
          social proof of the paid tier ("the newsletter that has 1,000
          paying readers").
        leadsTo: end-B-great
      - text: Free newsletter funded entirely by sponsorships ($5-15K per drop).
        points: 12
        pattern: ad-funded-only
        rationale: |
          Cleaner business model — no paywall complexity, faster
          revenue ramp because sponsorships start immediately. The
          tradeoff: you cap revenue at sponsorship saturation
          (~$500K-$1M ARR for a niche B2B newsletter), and the editorial
          starts to be shaped by what sponsors will pay for.
        consequence: |
          ARR hits $400K within 18 months. Editorial leans toward
          sponsor-friendly content. Subscriber growth flattens because
          the perceived value cap is visible.
        leadsTo: end-B-good
      - text: Free newsletter, eventually upsell to a paid SaaS product.
        points: 9
        pattern: newsletter-as-funnel
        rationale: |
          The Lenny's Rachitsky path — newsletter as top-of-funnel for
          a paid course or community or job board. Works if the audience
          is high-intent and you ship the product before the audience
          churns. Failure mode: the product never ships and the
          newsletter is unmonetized.
        consequence: |
          Newsletter grows but you don't ship the product in year one.
          Audience starts to wonder when monetization is coming. Some
          churn.
        leadsTo: end-B-mediocre
  end-A-great:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      The rebuild + benchmark combination repositioned you for the
      AI-search era. Pipeline recovered and grew. The company stayed in
      the content business but on a new distribution channel.
  end-A-good:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      Solid recovery without breakout. The rebuild worked but you
      forfeited the citation-magnet differentiator to a competitor.
  end-B-great:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      The newsletter pivot defined a new business. By year 2 you had
      ~50K subscribers, ~3K paying at $15/mo, and the company became
      a category-defining publication that didn't depend on Google at
      all.
  end-B-good:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      The ad-funded newsletter worked sustainably but capped sooner
      than the paid-tier scenario would have. Steady, not breakout.
  end-B-mediocre:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      The newsletter without monetization stalled. Audience growth
      slowed because the "what's the business" question was unanswered.
      You eventually shipped a paid tier in year 2.
  end-C:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      Paying for a shrinking channel accelerated the burn. The
      eventual pivot came 12 months late, with weaker terms because
      the cash position had deteriorated.
  end-D:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      The content-to-product pivot is high-variance. Some companies
      execute it brilliantly; many split focus and lose both
      businesses. Without specific product-team chops, the bet
      didn't compound.

## What's at stake here

This drill is playing out across thousands of content businesses in
2026. The companies that recognize Google as a **rented channel** and
build owned channels (newsletter, podcast, community) are surviving
the AI-search restructuring. The companies that try to defend
Google traffic with more SEO investment are watching unit economics
collapse.

The deeper pattern: **owned audiences are transferable across
channels; rented traffic is not.** A 50K-subscriber newsletter is
worth more in 2026 than 5M monthly Google visitors, because the
former is durable and the latter is being absorbed by AI Overviews.
