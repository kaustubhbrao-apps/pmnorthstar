  When a foundation-model lab absorbs your category as a feature, the
  game stops being about features and becomes about workflow + trust +
  vertical depth. Generic AI startups become commodity overnight; the
  ones with proprietary data, regulated industries, or specific
  workflow integrations survive.
intro: |
  You are the CEO of a $4M ARR AI startup. Your product is an AI sales
  assistant — drafts cold emails, summarizes calls, suggests follow-
  ups. ~200 customers, mostly SaaS sales teams. You raised a $12M
  Series A six months ago on the "AI-native sales agent" thesis.

  Yesterday OpenAI announced ChatGPT Agent — a built-in feature in
  ChatGPT (~700M weekly active users) that does roughly 80% of what
  your product does, available to every Pro user for free. The
  rollout is global.

  Your phone is ringing. Three customers have asked if they should
  cancel. Your board is convening an emergency call. Your sales VP
  wants to know what to tell her team.
nodes:
  start:
    dimension: founder
    prompt: |
      The category just got commoditized. Pick the move.
    options:
      - text: "Pivot vertical: pick a regulated industry (legal sales, medical sales, financial services sales) and rebuild for it."
        points: 5
        pattern: vertical-where-platforms-cant-fit
        rationale: |
          The right move when horizontal got commoditized. ChatGPT Agent
          is built for generic users; regulated industries have
          compliance requirements (HIPAA for medical, SEC for finance,
          attorney-client privilege for legal) that a horizontal
          consumer product structurally can't serve well. By picking
          one vertical and going deep — vertical-specific integrations,
          compliance certifications, domain fine-tuning — you turn a
          commoditized layer into a defensible enterprise business.
        consequence: |
          You pick legal sales (corporate development teams at law
          firms). The pivot takes 5 months. Of your 200 customers, 60
          fit the new ICP and convert; the rest churn. ARR temporarily
          drops to $1.5M, then rebuilds to $6M within 18 months at
          much higher LTV per customer.
        leadsTo: A-vertical-followup
      - text: "Sell now to an acquirer. The standalone window is closing."
        points: 3
        pattern: graceful-exit
        rationale: |
          Defensible. AI startups whose moats just evaporated can still
          have acquisition value — for the team, the customer
          relationships, the data, the specific integrations. A 60-90
          day acquisition window often produces better outcomes than
          18 months of trying to compete with a commoditized feature.
          Risk: acquisition valuations crater as the news spreads;
          the offer you'd get in week 1 is much higher than week 8.
        consequence: |
          You start conversations with three potential acquirers in
          week one. A larger sales-tech company offers $40M cash. You
          take it. Your team integrates, your investors get a 2-3x
          return, you move on to the next thing. Acceptable outcome.
        leadsTo: end-B
      - text: "Become a ChatGPT plugin / integration. Position as 'the best ChatGPT integration for sales workflows.'"
        points: 3
        pattern: ride-the-platform
        rationale: |
          Defensive integration play. You stop competing with ChatGPT
          and become a value-add on top of it. The TAM is enormous
          (700M ChatGPT users) but you're now a platform tenant —
          OpenAI controls your distribution, your pricing model, and
          can absorb your value any time. Works as a bridge strategy
          while you figure out the longer-term move. Doesn't work as
          the long-term strategy itself.
        consequence: |
          You ship a ChatGPT integration in 8 weeks. Discoverability
          spikes. ARR recovers to $5M. Then OpenAI updates the plugin
          guidelines twice in 6 months, eroding your integration depth.
          You're never fully comfortable.
        leadsTo: end-C
      - text: "Pivot to be the AI sales platform for non-English markets — Indian SMB, LATAM, SEA — where ChatGPT Agent quality is weaker."
        points: 4
        pattern: geographic-vertical
        rationale: |
          Underrated angle. Foundation models still have meaningful
          quality gaps in non-English languages and cultural contexts.
          Indian SMBs running sales in Hindi/Tamil, Latin American
          teams doing Spanish + Portuguese, Southeast Asian teams
          across multiple scripts — these markets have real demand and
          weaker direct competition from horizontal AI. Risk: smaller
          ARPUs, more market education needed.
        consequence: |
          You spend 4 months rebuilding for Indian SMB sales (Hindi +
          English). ARR migrates from $4M US to $2M India + $1M
          retained US = $3M. Growth rate accelerates because the new
          market is faster-moving and less competitive.
        leadsTo: end-D
  A-vertical-followup:
    dimension: business
    prompt: |
      Eighteen months into the legal-vertical pivot. ARR is $6M, 70
      customers, NPS 78. Two paths to scale: (a) go deeper in legal
      (financial services adjacent, compliance, audit), or (b) replicate
      the playbook in a second vertical (medical sales).
    options:
      - text: "Go deeper in legal-adjacent verticals. Add audit, compliance, regulatory consulting."
        points: 5
        pattern: dominate-one-region-first
        rationale: |
          The right call until you're #1 in your first vertical. Legal
          + compliance + audit share similar buyers (general counsel,
          compliance officers), similar regulations, similar workflow
          patterns. Adjacent expansion compounds without splitting
          focus. The playbook in vertical #2 (medical) needs different
          buyers, different sales motion, different compliance — a
          full rebuild.
        consequence: |
          Adjacent expansion lifts ARR to $14M in 12 months without
          adding meaningful team complexity. You become the defining
          company in legal/compliance AI. Acquisition offers come at
          strong multiples.
        leadsTo: end-A-great
      - text: "Replicate to medical sales now. The playbook is portable; the new vertical doubles the TAM."
        points: 3
        pattern: parallel-vertical-too-early
        rationale: |
          Defensible but premature. Two verticals at your stage means
          two sales motions, two compliance regimes, two product
          variants — and you're not yet dominant in either. Most
          vertical-AI companies that try to do two verticals before
          they've won one end up sub-scale in both.
        consequence: |
          ARR grows to $10M but team complexity doubles. Both verticals
          are sub-scale relative to focused competitors. The next round
          comes at weaker terms.
        leadsTo: end-A-mixed
  end-A-great:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      The vertical-then-adjacent-expansion strategy worked. You became
      the dominant AI for legal/compliance sales. Series B closed at
      strong multiples. Acquisition talks at $300M+ within 3 years.
  end-A-mixed:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      The parallel-vertical bet thinned the team. Both verticals
      grew but slower than a focused competitor would have. The
      company is sustainable but not category-defining.
  end-B:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      The acquisition closed cleanly. Investors recovered capital,
      team integrated, you started the next company. The vertical-
      pivot opportunity got captured by a different startup that
      didn't capitulate.
  end-C:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      Platform-tenant status produced steady but bounded revenue.
      Every OpenAI plugin policy change hurt you. By year 3 you'd
      effectively become a sales-tech integrator with no independent
      defensibility.
  end-D:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      The geographic-vertical pivot worked. India + LATAM revenue
      compounded. By year 3 you were the default AI sales tool in
      non-English emerging markets, with quality and pricing tuned
      specifically for those geographies.

## What's at stake here

The pattern: foundation-model labs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) ship
new features quarterly that absorb capabilities that used to be
standalone products. AI startups built as "GPT wrapper for X" face
existential questions every time the platform extends.

The companies that survive consistently make one of three moves:
1. **Vertical pivot** to a regulated or specialized market the
   platform can't serve well (legal, medical, finance, defense)
2. **Geographic pivot** to non-English markets where platform
   quality lags
3. **Workflow integration depth** that the horizontal product
   structurally can't match

The companies that don't survive: those that try to compete
horizontally on features against a platform with 700M users and a
free tier.
