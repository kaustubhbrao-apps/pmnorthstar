  The hardest pivot for a successful company isn't building a new
  product — it's giving up the religion that built the old one.
  Incumbent transformations almost always require admitting that the
  thing your culture organized around is now the thing holding you
  back.
intro: |
  You are the newly-appointed CEO of a publicly-traded $400B+ market
  cap software giant. Your predecessor built the company around two
  identities: (1) we make operating systems, and (2) Windows is the
  hill we die on. Every other product — productivity software,
  servers, mobile attempts, browsers — has been treated as a Windows
  feature, never as an independent business.

  The reality on your desk in your first 30 days:
  - The desktop OS market is mature and shrinking
  - Mobile (where you have <5% share) is now the dominant platform
  - A competitor's cloud platform has crossed $5B in revenue with
    50%+ YoY growth, while your cloud is at $1B
  - Your developer-tools division is openly hostile to non-Windows
    development
  - Your office productivity suite ships only on Windows, even
    though 70% of your users have other devices in their lives
  - Your stock is roughly flat over 10 years while peers have 5-10x'd

  The board wants a 90-day plan.
nodes:
  start:
    dimension: founder
    prompt: |
      Windows is the religion. The market has moved. Pick the move.
    options:
      - text: "Stay focused on Windows. The desktop install base is still 1.5B users. Defend the home turf."
        points: 1
        pattern: defend-the-shrinking-fortress
        rationale: |
          The predecessor's strategy, dressed up as discipline. The
          desktop install base is real but the unit economics of OS
          sales are flat or declining. Defending the fortress means
          you don't compete in the categories that are growing (cloud,
          mobile, productivity-on-any-device). Each quarter that
          passes, the moat around Windows shrinks while competitors
          build new moats elsewhere.
        consequence: |
          Five years in, Windows revenue is flat. Cloud competitors
          have 5x'd. Mobile is irrecoverable. The stock trades at the
          same multiple it did when you started. The board eventually
          replaces you.
        leadsTo: end-A
      - text: "Pivot to cloud-first. Office on every platform, including iOS and Android. Open-source the developer stack. Compete with AWS aggressively."
        points: 5
        pattern: cannibalize-the-religion
        rationale: |
          The bet that defines the next decade. You're saying: the
          thing that built us is now the thing holding us back. Office
          on iOS means selling productivity software to users on
          competitor platforms — heretical to the existing culture but
          obvious if you look at where users actually are. Open-
          sourcing the dev stack means competing with the open-source
          competitors who've been eating your enterprise lunch.
          Aggressive cloud means picking a fight with AWS while
          you're behind. Each move is internally controversial; the
          combination is transformative.
        consequence: |
          You announce Office on iOS in your first 90 days. The
          Windows division revolts internally. Then it ships, and
          ~50M iPhone users become Office customers in 6 months.
          Cloud growth accelerates to 90%+ YoY. Developer goodwill
          returns. Stock starts compounding for the first time in a
          decade.
        leadsTo: B-pivot-followup
      - text: "Pick one new bet (cloud OR mobile OR cross-platform Office). Don't try to fight on all three fronts."
        points: 3
        pattern: pivot-but-pick-one
        rationale: |
          Defensible discipline. You can argue that fighting on three
          fronts means winning on none. The case for picking cloud
          alone is strong (largest growth market, you have an
          existing foothold). Risk: by not making cross-platform
          Office and dev-stack moves in parallel, you don't actually
          shift the company's identity. Cloud alone is a divisional
          win, not a transformation.
        consequence: |
          Cloud revenue grows strongly under focused investment. But
          the rest of the company stays Windows-centric. Mobile
          remains lost. Cross-platform productivity is captured by
          Google. The company is healthier but not transformed.
        leadsTo: end-C
      - text: "Acquire a major competitor (a social network, a developer tool, an enterprise platform). Buy your way into a new identity."
        points: 2
        pattern: acquire-instead-of-build
        rationale: |
          Tempting but rarely sufficient. Major acquisitions can
          accelerate a transformation but they can't replace the
          internal cultural shift. If the company still believes
          Windows is the hill, the acquired company gets absorbed and
          neutered (the LinkedIn or GitHub of an unreformed Microsoft
          would have been a different story). Acquisitions amplify
          the strategy you already have; they don't change it.
        consequence: |
          You acquire a major enterprise platform for $20B. Culture
          clash absorbs the acquisition. Two years later, the
          acquired company's growth has slowed. The transformation
          stalls.
        leadsTo: end-D
  B-pivot-followup:
    dimension: business
    prompt: |
      Three years into the pivot. Cloud revenue is now $30B+/year and
      growing 40%+ YoY. Office subscriptions cross 200M paying users.
      Stock has doubled. The next decision: AI. A small lab building
      large language models needs $1B to keep going. They've also
      offered to keep their team and IP independent — they'd be a
      partner, not a subsidiary.
    options:
      - text: "Invest the $1B with strict integration: their tech becomes part of your cloud. Build a moat around the cloud + AI combination."
        points: 5
        pattern: strategic-investment-over-acquisition
        rationale: |
          The right structure for an emerging-capability bet. Full
          acquisition would absorb the lab's culture and slow their
          velocity. A strategic investment with cloud-exclusivity
          gives you the AI moat without killing the lab. The lab gets
          capital and infrastructure; you get cloud + AI as a combined
          enterprise sale. Both sides benefit asymmetrically vs. a
          standard acquisition.
        consequence: |
          You invest $1B for cloud-exclusive infrastructure rights and
          a substantial equity stake. The lab keeps autonomy and
          ships breakthrough products that run on your cloud. Within
          18 months, cloud + AI becomes the fastest-growing enterprise
          category in tech. Your market cap crosses $2T.
        leadsTo: end-B-great
      - text: "Acquire them fully. Bring the lab in-house. Control the IP completely."
        points: 3
        pattern: full-acquisition
        rationale: |
          Cleaner ownership, riskier execution. Full acquisition gives
          you complete IP control but typically slows the acquired
          team's velocity (compensation friction, culture friction,
          decision-rights friction). The lab's most talented people
          tend to leave 18-36 months post-acquisition. You'd own the
          IP but might lose the team.
        consequence: |
          Acquisition closes at $5B. Two years in, ~40% of the
          founding research team has left for competing labs. The
          remaining product still ships but the velocity has slowed.
          Cloud + AI grows but slower than the partnership scenario
          would have produced.
        leadsTo: end-B-mixed
      - text: "Pass. Build AI internally instead. Don't depend on an external lab."
        points: 1
        pattern: not-invented-here
        rationale: |
          The mistake your predecessor would have made. Building AI
          internally from scratch when world-class labs already exist
          means losing 2-3 years to talent acquisition and research
          ramp-up. By the time your internal lab catches up,
          competitors who partnered with external labs have shipped
          two product generations.
        consequence: |
          You build internally. Two years later your AI is generation
          behind external labs. A competitor's external partnership
          has captured the cloud + AI enterprise narrative. You catch
          up eventually but with less category leadership.
        leadsTo: end-B-mediocre
  end-A:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      Defending Windows preserved the desktop business but missed
      every growth category of the era. The company stayed valuable
      but the multiple compressed. The transformation eventually
      happened under a different CEO five years late.
  end-B-great:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      The pivot defined one of the most studied incumbent
      transformations in tech history. Market cap grew from $400B to
      $3T+ within a decade. Cloud + AI + cross-platform Office
      became the three pillars of the company's identity. The
      Windows-as-religion era was replaced by software-runs-everywhere.
  end-B-mixed:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      The full acquisition produced revenue but lost team velocity.
      The cloud + AI story compounded but slower than partnership
      would have. Still a strong outcome — just below ceiling.
  end-B-mediocre:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      Building AI internally was the slow path. The category
      narrative was captured by competitors who partnered externally.
      You eventually caught up but never led.
  end-C:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      Cloud-focused pivot worked divisionally but didn't transform
      the company's identity. Other categories stayed Windows-
      centric and were lost. The stock grew but not at the pace a
      full transformation would have produced.
  end-D:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      The acquisition without cultural reform got absorbed by the
      existing identity. Two years later, the acquired company's
      growth had slowed. The transformation stalled and you were
      replaced.

## What actually happened

This drill is based on **Satya Nadella taking over as Microsoft CEO
in February 2014**. Microsoft was a $300B company that had spent a
decade losing every new platform — mobile, search, social — while
defending Windows as the company's defining identity.

Nadella's first major move was **Office on iOS**, announced in
March 2014, less than 60 days into his tenure. Internal Microsoft
veterans called it heresy. The product shipped, became the highest-
rated productivity app on iOS within 6 months, and signaled that
the company's identity had changed.

Subsequent moves: **Microsoft Loves Linux** (2015), open-sourcing
.NET (2014), the **$26B LinkedIn acquisition** (2016), the **$7.5B
GitHub acquisition** (2018), and the **$1B+ OpenAI partnership**
starting in 2019 with the unique structure of strategic investment
+ Azure-exclusivity rather than full acquisition.

Microsoft's market cap grew from **~$300B in early 2014 to over
$3.5T by 2024** — one of the most consequential incumbent
transformations in business history. The Nadella era replaced
"Windows everywhere" with "our software runs everywhere," and the
shift unlocked categories Microsoft had spent a decade missing.

The principle Nadella later articulated: *"Our industry doesn't
respect tradition — it only respects innovation. The hardest part
of leading a successful company is killing the religion that made
it successful."*
