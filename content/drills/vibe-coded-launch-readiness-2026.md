  Speed of building is now uncoupled from quality of shipping.
  AI-assisted code generation produces working prototypes faster than
  any prior tooling — but working ≠ shippable. The new founder skill
  is knowing what to slow down on after the build is fast.
intro: |
  You are the solo founder of an AI-powered scheduling app, built
  over 4 weekends using Cursor + Claude. The app works. You have:
  fast onboarding, calendar sync, AI-suggested meeting times, a
  Stripe checkout, basic auth. ~12 friends are using it daily and
  loving it. You haven't told anyone outside that circle.

  You're considering a Product Hunt launch this Thursday. You also
  haven't done any of the following: written a privacy policy,
  set up error monitoring, run a security audit, written terms of
  service, set up customer support, run any accessibility checks,
  added rate limiting on the API, or shipped a custom 404 page.
  Your default favicon is the Next.js logo and your meta tags say
  "Create Next App".
nodes:
  start:
    dimension: founder
    prompt: |
      Launch Thursday on Product Hunt, or fix the basics first?
    options:
      - text: Launch Thursday. Ride the build momentum. Fix the basics in response to feedback.
        points: 3
        pattern: speed-over-trust
        rationale: |
          The "ship fast, iterate later" instinct misapplied. Product
          Hunt readers are specifically the audience that notices
          the missing-favicon, "Create Next App" title, no privacy
          policy combination — those signal "vibe-coded side
          project" and dramatically reduce conversion to paying
          customers. You'd be burning the launch moment for a
          product that visibly isn't a business yet.
        consequence: |
          Launch lands in the top 20 on PH. ~3K signups but
          ~80% bounce within 2 minutes. Comments mock the missing
          favicon and the "Welcome to Create Next App" tab title.
          The launch becomes a meme about vibe-coded apps.
        leadsTo: end-A
      - text: Spend 3 days fixing the basics — favicon, meta tags, privacy policy, 404, error monitoring. Launch the following Thursday.
        points: 15
        pattern: minimum-viable-trust
        rationale: |
          The right balance. You're not adding features; you're
          buying credibility. The basics (favicon, real title,
          privacy policy, custom 404, error monitoring) are 1-3
          days of work and transform the perception of the product
          from "side project" to "real business." You'd run CheckIt
          on the product and aim for a 70+ score before launching.
        consequence: |
          You spend 3 days on the basics. CheckIt score moves from
          42 to 78. Launch the next Thursday on PH; signups
          convert to paid at 3x the rate the original launch would
          have achieved.
        leadsTo: B-fix-basics-followup
      - text: Skip Product Hunt. Soft-launch to your existing friends + early-adopter network. Get to 100 paying users before any public launch.
        points: 12
        pattern: dark-launch-then-public
        rationale: |
          Defensible patience. You're forfeiting the Product Hunt
          moment but you're also reducing the risk of a public
          launch falling on a product that's not ready. By the
          time you do go public, you have signal, testimonials,
          and a polished product. The cost: you give up the
          PH-driven inbound spike that early-stage products
          benefit from.
        consequence: |
          You reach 80 paying users in 8 weeks through warm
          intros. The PH launch (at month 3) lands with social
          proof and converts well, but at lower volume than a
          first-launch would have produced.
        leadsTo: end-C
      - text: Add 10 more features first. The product is too thin for Product Hunt.
        points: 3
        pattern: feature-creep-before-launch
        rationale: |
          Wrong diagnosis. The product isn't thin; the *trust
          signals* are thin. Adding features doesn't fix favicon
          + privacy policy + custom 404. You'd be building more
          surface area on top of a foundation that signals "not
          a business yet."
        consequence: |
          Eight more weeks of feature work. The product has 18
          features and still no favicon or privacy policy. The
          eventual launch lands soft because the trust signals
          weren't fixed.
        leadsTo: end-D
  B-fix-basics-followup:
    dimension: product
    prompt: |
      You spent 3 days. CheckIt score is 78. Launch is in 4 days.
      Two final questions: should you add a free tier or charge
      from day one? And should you build a custom landing page or
      keep the in-app marketing copy?
    options:
      - text: Free tier with a 14-day trial for paid features. Custom landing page.
        points: 15
        pattern: standard-onboarding
        rationale: |
          The compounding option. Free tier maximizes top-of-
          funnel; trial pulls users into paid. Custom landing page
          (separate from the app) signals professionalism and
          gives you marketing copy that converts. The "standard
          SaaS playbook" works for a reason.
        consequence: |
          Launch lands well. ~5K signups, ~12% start the 14-day
          trial, ~3% convert to paid. ARR hits $4K MRR in week
          one — small but real.
        leadsTo: end-B-great
      - text: Paid only. $15/month. No free tier. Charge from sign-up.
        points: 9
        pattern: monetize-immediately
        rationale: |
          Defensible discipline. Paid-only filters for serious
          users and tests willingness-to-pay immediately. Cost:
          dramatically smaller top-of-funnel, slower compounding
          virality. Works for high-value B2B products; uncertain
          for consumer-adjacent products.
        consequence: |
          ~800 signups, ~60 convert to paid. Higher per-user
          revenue but slower growth. Series A pitch will need to
          show stronger product-market signal.
        leadsTo: end-B-mixed
      - text: Free forever. Monetize via API access later.
        points: 6
        pattern: defer-monetization
        rationale: |
          Premature growth-first thinking. You're a solo founder
          who needs to demonstrate revenue traction; deferring
          monetization to "later" means going into the next
          fundraise with no monetization signal. The API-tier
          idea is fine but should be additive, not the only
          revenue path.
        consequence: |
          ~10K signups, $0 ARR. Fundraise conversations stall
          because there's no revenue. You add a paid tier 4
          months later, breaking some user trust.
        leadsTo: end-B-mediocre
  end-A:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      The premature launch became the case study other founders
      quoted on what not to do. You spent the next 4 weeks fixing
      the basics and re-launching, but the brand was already
      compromised in the early-adopter community.
  end-B-great:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      The "fix the basics + standard playbook" combination
      compounded perfectly. ARR hit $50K MRR by month 6, Series
      seed closed cleanly, and the product became a category
      reference for AI scheduling.
  end-B-mixed:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      Paid-only filtered well but slowed compounding. The product
      grew steadily; the fundraise was harder than necessary
      because growth metrics were thinner.
  end-B-mediocre:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      Free-forever drove signups but the revenue conversation was
      a problem at every fundraise. The eventual paid tier broke
      some trust with early users.
  end-C:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      The dark-launch worked. Slower compounding, lower volume,
      higher quality. The eventual PH launch lands cleanly.
  end-D:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      Eight weeks of feature work didn't move the launch outcome.
      The product was always more feature-rich than necessary
      and always lacked the trust signals that converted users.

## What's at stake here

The pattern: AI-assisted coding made the *building* fast. Vibe-coded
apps can ship in a weekend. The *shipping* part — favicon, meta
tags, privacy policy, 404 page, error monitoring, accessibility,
basic SEO — is the new skill that separates real businesses from
hobby projects.

This is exactly why **CheckIt** exists at northstar — to give
vibe-coding founders a 30-second audit of whether their product
looks like a business or like a side project. The drill above is
the human-side of the same problem: knowing when to slow down.
