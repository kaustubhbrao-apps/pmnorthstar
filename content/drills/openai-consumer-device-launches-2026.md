  When a foundation-model lab ships hardware, every AI app builder
  faces the platform question: become a tenant, stay sovereign, or
  pivot to where the platform won't reach. The wrong choice is
  pretending the platform shift doesn't change your strategy.
intro: |
  You are the founder of a $3M ARR AI productivity app. ~80K paying
  users at $5/mo on iOS + Android. Your app combines voice notes,
  AI-summarized meetings, and task extraction. You've been growing
  20% MoM.

  This morning, OpenAI announced the **ChatGPT Companion** — a pocket-
  sized hardware device built in partnership with Jony Ive's firm.
  It runs ChatGPT natively, has all-day battery, an always-on mic, a
  small screen for quick interactions, and ships in Q1 2027 for $399
  pre-order. Press is calling it "the first true AI-native device."

  The device's core demo features: voice notes, meeting summaries,
  task capture. Your exact product. Built into hardware that ships in
  6 months.

  Pre-orders cross 100K in the first 24 hours.
nodes:
  start:
    dimension: founder
    prompt: |
      OpenAI just announced hardware that does what your app does. Pick.
    options:
      - text: Build a companion app for the device. Position as 'the productivity app for ChatGPT Companion.'
        points: 12
        pattern: become-the-platform-tenant
        rationale: |
          Defensible bridge play. If you can't beat them, plug into them.
          OpenAI will need third-party apps that extend the device's
          base capabilities; being one of the first plug-in apps gives
          you early discoverability on the platform. The tradeoff:
          you're now a tenant, OpenAI controls your distribution and
          can absorb your value any time. Works as bridge strategy
          while you figure out the next move.
        consequence: |
          You ship a Companion app in 5 months, ahead of the device
          launch. You're featured in OpenAI's launch keynote. App
          installs hit 200K in the first 60 days post-launch. Then
          OpenAI updates their first-party app to absorb 40% of your
          features 18 months later. You're playing defense ever since.
        leadsTo: A-tenant-followup
      - text: 'Pivot vertical: re-position the app for a specific profession (lawyers, doctors, sales reps) and ignore the hardware entirely.'
        points: 15
        pattern: vertical-where-device-cant-fit
        rationale: |
          The right contrarian bet. The ChatGPT Companion is built for
          general consumers. Vertical professionals have compliance
          (HIPAA for medical, attorney-client privilege for legal),
          integration (Clio, Epic, Salesforce), and workflow needs the
          device structurally can't serve. By picking one profession
          and going deep, you stop competing with the device and
          start serving customers the device can't.
        consequence: |
          You pick lawyers. Pivot takes 6 months. Of your 80K paying
          users, 12K fit the new ICP at higher ARPU ($30/mo). ARR
          temporarily drops to $4M then climbs to $9M within 18 months
          at much better unit economics. The ChatGPT Companion eats
          consumer share; you own legal productivity.
        leadsTo: B-vertical-followup
      - text: Pivot to be a multi-model app. Position as 'works with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Apple Intelligence.' Hardware-agnostic.
        points: 9
        pattern: model-agnostic-bridge
        rationale: |
          Defensive moat. By being model-agnostic, you avoid lock-in to
          any one ecosystem. Users can pick their preferred AI; you
          provide the unified workflow on top. The challenge: this is
          a feature, not a product strategy. As foundation models
          differentiate more, "works with all of them" gets harder to
          maintain and less meaningful.
        consequence: |
          You ship multi-model support in 3 months. Marketing message
          is "your AI productivity, your model choice." Differentiation
          works briefly. Within 12 months, most users have one default
          model and the model-picker becomes irrelevant.
        leadsTo: end-C
      - text: Sell the company to OpenAI before the device ships and your ARR drops.
        points: 9
        pattern: exit-before-the-shift
        rationale: |
          Defensible. Acquisitions of category-overlap apps tend to
          happen pre-launch when the platform wants to expand its
          first-party feature set. The window closes once the device
          ships and your numbers start dropping. Selling now means
          selling at peak ARR. Risk: OpenAI may not want to acquire
          (they may prefer to build), and approaching them signals
          weakness.
        consequence: |
          You make discreet inquiries. OpenAI passes — they're building
          internally. Anthropic offers $30M; you take it. The
          acquisition closes 90 days later. Team integrated, you move
          to Anthropic. Your category gets absorbed both directions.
        leadsTo: end-D
  A-tenant-followup:
    dimension: product
    prompt: |
      Your Companion app shipped. 200K installs post-device-launch.
      OpenAI is reviewing third-party app guidelines monthly — they've
      already restricted always-on background processing and limited
      file system access. You can see the platform tightening. Pick.
    options:
      - text: Stay platform-aligned. Adapt to every guideline change. Don't fight.
        points: 9
        pattern: comply-and-keep-running
        rationale: |
          Survival mode. You stay in the platform but with shrinking
          differentiation as each guideline change reduces what you
          can do. Useful as a known revenue floor while you build a
          second strategy. Failure mode: the platform absorbs every
          differentiating feature you ship.
        consequence: |
          You stay in the app store but become indistinguishable from
          OpenAI's first-party app over 24 months. Revenue plateaus.
          You're employed but not building a real business.
        leadsTo: end-A-stable
      - text: Build a parallel product that doesn't depend on the device. Use Companion as one of several distribution channels.
        points: 15
        pattern: distribute-don't-depend
        rationale: |
          The right long-term move. The Companion app is one
          distribution channel; iOS, Android, web, and other AI
          devices are others. Building distribution across multiple
          surfaces means no single platform shift can kill you. The
          Companion app continues to drive top-of-funnel; the core
          product diversifies risk.
        consequence: |
          You spend 6 months rebuilding the core product as
          multi-surface. ARR diversifies — 40% Companion, 35% iOS/
          Android, 25% web. When OpenAI tightens guidelines further,
          you absorb the hit but don't crater.
        leadsTo: end-A-good
  B-vertical-followup:
    dimension: business
    prompt: |
      Eighteen months into the legal-productivity pivot. ARR is $9M,
      12,000 paying lawyers at $30/mo. You can scale two ways:
      (a) add more verticals (medical, financial advisors), or
      (b) go deeper in legal — case management integration,
      e-discovery, billing workflows.
    options:
      - text: Go deeper in legal. Become the productivity layer that integrates with case-management software.
        points: 15
        pattern: depth-before-breadth
        rationale: |
          The compounding bet. Lawyers who already pay you for AI
          productivity will pay more for AI productivity tightly
          integrated into Clio, MyCase, PracticePanther — because the
          workflow lift is multiplicative. Adjacent integrations don't
          require new buyers or new sales motions; they extend your
          ARPU with the customers you have.
        consequence: |
          Three Clio integrations ship in 9 months. ARPU rises from
          $30 to $75/mo. Churn drops. ARR hits $20M with the same
          customer count. The company becomes "AI for legal practice"
          not just "AI productivity."
        leadsTo: end-B-great
      - text: Add medical + financial advisors. Three verticals, three sales motions, three compliance regimes.
        points: 9
        pattern: spread-too-thin
        rationale: |
          Premature breadth. Without dominating legal first, two more
          verticals split engineering and sales attention. Each
          vertical needs its own compliance certifications, integration
          partnerships, and ICP-specific positioning. You'd be
          sub-scale in all three.
        consequence: |
          ARR grows to $14M across three verticals. None are
          category-leading. Sales cycle elongates as the team
          context-switches. The next round comes at flatter terms.
        leadsTo: end-B-mixed
  end-A-stable:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      The platform-tenant path produced bounded but stable revenue.
      You're a working business but not a defensible one. Every
      OpenAI guideline change hurts.
  end-A-good:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      The multi-surface pivot recovered diversification. The Companion
      channel was one of several. When OpenAI tightened further, you
      absorbed the hit. The company is healthy and sovereign.
  end-B-great:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      The legal-vertical plus integration-depth combination became the
      textbook on surviving platform shifts. You owned legal
      productivity, integrated with the practice-management stack,
      and grew through the OpenAI Companion era without ever
      depending on the device.
  end-B-mixed:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      Three verticals at sub-scale produced a working business but
      not a category-defining one. The team eventually focused on
      legal as the strongest, deprecating the others.
  end-C:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      Model-agnostic positioning worked briefly. As foundation models
      differentiated, the picker became friction. You eventually
      committed to one model anyway.
  end-D:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      The acquisition closed at a reasonable price. Your team's
      productivity layer became Anthropic's third-party offering.
      Your category got absorbed by both major platforms within 24
      months.

## What's at stake here

The pattern: every major platform shift (mobile, voice assistants,
spatial computing, now AI-native devices) creates the same
strategic moment for builders sitting in the soon-to-be-absorbed
category. The question is never "should we ship for the platform" —
it's "what defensible position do we hold that the platform can't
absorb?"

The answers consistent across hardware platform shifts:
1. **Vertical depth** that requires compliance / integrations the
   platform won't ship (legal, medical, financial)
2. **Multi-surface distribution** so no single platform controls
   your destiny
3. **Workflow ownership** that the platform's general-purpose
   product can't match

The companies that *only* become platform tenants are eventually
absorbed. The companies that maintain sovereign distribution
survive.
