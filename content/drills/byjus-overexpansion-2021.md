  Easy capital is the most dangerous moment in a startup's life. When
  investors are pushing money at you, the discipline isn't "deploy it
  faster" — it's "what would we do if we had half this much?"
  Companies that scale their burn to match available capital almost
  always collapse when the capital cycle turns.
intro: |
  You are the founder-CEO of India's largest education technology
  company. Two years into a global pandemic, your business is at peak
  momentum — schools are closed, parents are paying for online
  tutoring, your subscriber base has grown 5x in 24 months. You've
  raised over $1.5B in the last 18 months alone. Cash position is
  ~$2B. Valuation just touched $22B in the most recent round.

  Your investment bankers and your board are pushing aggressive
  acquisitions. Three deals are on the table simultaneously:
  - A US-based one-on-one tutoring service ($1B all-cash)
  - A US-based kids coding school ($600M cash + stock)
  - An Indian offline tutorial chain ($1B cash)

  Plus organic expansion into 6 new countries (UAE, UK, Brazil,
  Mexico, Indonesia, Vietnam) is on the table. Plus salesforce
  expansion (~5,000 additional sales reps for the door-to-door
  vertical you've been growing in tier-2 India cities).

  Your CFO says you can technically do all of it.

    dimension: founder
    prompt: |
      $2B in the bank, $22B valuation, three big acquisitions plus
      organic expansion on the table. Pick.
    options:
      - text: "Do all three acquisitions plus international expansion plus salesforce growth. Deploy capital while it's available."
        points: 0
        pattern: deploy-capital-to-match-supply
        rationale: |
          The fatal mistake easy-capital cycles always produce. You're
          treating the cash position as a thing to spend rather than
          as a runway buffer. Three major acquisitions in a single
          year mean three integration teams, three culture mergers,
          three different cost structures to absorb. Plus simultaneous
          international + offline expansion. Each individual move is
          defensible; doing all of them at once is suicidal because
          execution attention is finite.
        consequence: |
          You close all three deals in 6 months. Integration is chaotic.
          The US acquisitions burn $30M+/month. The offline chain
          requires aggressive ground operations. International cities
          don't show product-market-fit. Cash position drops from $2B
          to $400M within 18 months as the funding cycle turns.
        leadsTo: end-A
      - text: "Do one acquisition (the US tutoring service). Defer international. Pause salesforce expansion."
        points: 5
        pattern: capital-discipline-during-boom
        rationale: |
          The discipline move. You'd be saying: "the capital is real
          but the execution capacity isn't infinite, and focus
          compounds faster than spread." One acquisition is integrable;
          you can keep the rest of the business focused on operational
          excellence. The deferred moves stay available if and when
          you have capacity. Investors will push back on the smaller
          deployment — but founders who deploy slowly during booms
          tend to survive the busts.
        consequence: |
          You close the US tutoring acquisition for $1B. Integration
          takes 9 months but lands well. Core India business stays
          profitable. When the capital cycle turns in 2022, you have
          $1B+ runway and operational discipline. Valuation
          re-rates but the company survives intact.
        leadsTo: B-discipline-followup
      - text: "Decline all three acquisitions. Return half the cash to investors. Stay focused on India."
        points: 4
        pattern: capital-return-when-overcapitalized
        rationale: |
          The principled extreme. Returning capital is rarely chosen
          but often correct when you can't deploy it productively.
          Sends a strong signal to investors about discipline. The
          downside: investors who placed capital may push back hard;
          you'd damage the relationship for the next round (which you
          probably won't need given the strong cash position anyway).
        consequence: |
          You return $1B in capital to investors. Some are furious;
          some are deeply impressed. The remaining $1B funds 5 years
          of disciplined growth. When the capital cycle turns, you're
          structurally insulated. The company eventually IPOs at a
          stronger multiple than peers who deployed and crashed.
        leadsTo: end-C
      - text: "Two acquisitions plus selective international. Skip the offline chain (too operationally heavy)."
        points: 2
        pattern: half-the-mistake
        rationale: |
          Defensible-looking compromise. You're picking which fires to
          start. The problem: two acquisitions plus international is
          still too much for one team in 18 months. The offline chain
          was actually the most operationally heavy of the three, but
          the US deals are culturally most complex. You're still
          spreading attention across more vectors than you can manage.
        consequence: |
          You close both acquisitions. International launches drag on.
          Cash position drops to $700M. When the cycle turns, you're
          mid-integration on both and can't easily course-correct.
        leadsTo: end-D
  B-discipline-followup:
    dimension: business
    prompt: |
      Twelve months into the disciplined integration. The US tutoring
      service is profitable. India business steady. Now the capital
      cycle is turning — venture markets are tightening, your last
      round closed at $22B but bridge offers are coming in at $12B.
      You have $1B in cash. What do you do?
    options:
      - text: "Take the $12B bridge. Accept the down round to lock in 2 more years of runway."
        points: 4
        pattern: take-the-down-round
        rationale: |
          Often the right move. Down rounds hurt morale and dilute
          founders, but they're survivable. Burning through runway
          waiting for valuations to recover is not. Founders who take
          down rounds during cycle turns consistently survive; those
          who delay raises trying to preserve valuation often go to
          zero.
        consequence: |
          You take the bridge at $12B. Some employee morale takes a
          hit. The runway extends to ~3 years. By year 4, the
          business is profitable and the company eventually re-IPOs at
          a recovery valuation.
        leadsTo: end-B-good
      - text: "Decline the bridge. Cut costs aggressively to extend the existing runway."
        points: 5
        pattern: cut-cost-not-valuation
        rationale: |
          Strong call when the business can sustain. With $1B in cash
          and reduced burn, you can survive 3+ years without raising.
          Avoiding the down round preserves cap-table simplicity and
          signals confidence. The cuts hurt — layoffs, paused
          expansion, exec compensation cuts — but they're recoverable.
          Valuation declines, not equity dilution.
        consequence: |
          You cut staff by 25%. Burn drops from $80M/month to $30M.
          Runway extends to 4 years. The capital cycle eventually
          recovers; you raise at $18B in 2025 without having taken the
          down round.
        leadsTo: end-B-great
      - text: "Bet on a recovery. Don't raise. Don't cut. Stay the course."
        points: 1
        pattern: hope-as-strategy
        rationale: |
          The fatal optimism. Cycles don't recover on your timeline;
          they recover when they recover. Without cutting or raising,
          you'd burn through $1B in 12-18 months and end up raising
          at $5-6B (worse than the $12B bridge you declined). The
          time to act is before the cash position becomes desperate.
        consequence: |
          You burn through cash. By month 14, you raise at $4B on
          punishing terms. Founders dilute heavily. The company
          survives but the equity story is broken.
        leadsTo: end-B-mediocre
  end-A:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      The all-three-acquisitions plus expansion path was a textbook
      capital cycle failure. Integration costs compounded. Burn
      outran revenue. When the funding cycle turned, the company
      couldn't course-correct fast enough. Multiple down rounds
      followed. Founders eventually replaced. Valuation crashed from
      $22B to under $1B within 3 years.
  end-B-good:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      The disciplined-integration plus down-round path was painful
      but survived. The company recovered to a sustainable position
      with a smaller but real business. Eventually IPO-ed at a
      meaningful (if not peak) valuation.
  end-B-great:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      The disciplined-integration plus cost-cutting path was the
      cleanest outcome. The company avoided dilution, survived the
      cycle, and emerged stronger. Discipline-during-boom plus
      discipline-during-bust = compound trust with employees and
      investors.
  end-B-mediocre:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      Hoping for a cycle recovery cost you valuation, cap-table
      health, and founder equity. The eventual raise came on
      brutal terms.
  end-C:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      Returning capital was the radical right answer. The smaller,
      focused business survived the cycle and grew through it. The
      relationship with investors took years to repair but the
      company became the textbook on capital discipline.
  end-D:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      The half-bet failed in the predictable way. Two acquisitions
      were too many to integrate while running the core business.
      Cash burned faster than projected. The company ended up needing
      a rescue round.

## What actually happened

This drill is based on **Byju's collapse from $22B to near-zero
between 2021-2024**. Byju Raveendran's company raised over $5B in
total funding through the pandemic boom, valued at $22B at peak.
The company made multiple major acquisitions in rapid succession:
**WhiteHat Jr ($300M, 2020), Aakash Educational Services ($1B,
2021), Epic ($500M, 2021), Great Learning ($600M, 2021),
Toppr ($150M, 2021)** — among many others.

When the capital cycle turned in mid-2022, Byju's was unable to
absorb the integration burden. Burn outpaced revenue. Investors
wrote down the company multiple times. By 2024, **valuation had
crashed to under $1B**, with multiple investors marking the equity
at $0. Lender disputes, founder removal proceedings, and bankruptcy
adjacent litigation followed.

The company that maintained capital discipline in the same era
(Zerodha, profitable, never raised VC, ~$1B revenue, ~$2-3B valuation
without taking outside capital) demonstrated the alternative path
clearly.

The principle: **the moment investors are pushing money at you is the
exact moment to ask what you would do with half as much.** Companies
that scale their burn to match capital supply almost always collapse
when supply contracts.
