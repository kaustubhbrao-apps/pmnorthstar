  Don't pivot a production stack on a model release. The right time to
  switch foundation models is when your wrappers and benchmarks tell you
  to, not when the press release does. Hype-driven migrations cost more
  in eng time than the marginal capability buys back in user value.
intro: |
  You are the CTO and a co-founder of an AI-powered customer support
  startup. ~$1.2M ARR, 18 months in, Series A close is six weeks out.
  Your entire production stack runs on GPT-4 — your prompts are
  GPT-4-tuned, your evals are GPT-4-benchmarked, your enterprise
  contracts cite "GPT-4" by name in the SLA.

  This morning, Anthropic announced Claude 5: meaningfully better at
  instruction-following on internal benchmarks, 40% cheaper per token,
  300ms faster median response time. Twitter is on fire. Two of your
  enterprise customers have already DM'd asking if you'll move. Your
  Series A lead investor sent a Slack: "Are you switching?"

  Engineering capacity is the constraint: you have 3 engineers, all
  shipping the product roadmap that the fundraise is based on.
nodes:
  start:
    dimension: founder
    prompt: |
      The team is asking what to do. Engineering can do roughly one
      "big thing" before the Series A close. Pick the move.
    options:
      - text: "Migrate the production stack to Claude 5 in the next sprint"
        points: 0
        pattern: hype-driven-migration
        rationale: |
          The fastest path to look responsive. The cost: rewrites your
          GPT-4-tuned prompts, breaks every eval baseline you've been
          quoting, requires re-running enterprise compliance reviews
          ("GPT-4" was in the SLA), and burns the only "big thing" you
          had before fundraise close. You're optimizing for being on the
          new shiny thing rather than for delivering the product you
          promised investors.
        consequence: |
          The migration takes 4 weeks and breaks two enterprise customers'
          integration tests mid-sprint. You miss the fundraise close
          deadline by 2 weeks. Lead investor moves to "let's revisit
          after you stabilize."
        leadsTo: A-migrate-followup
      - text: "Quietly ship a model-agnostic abstraction layer. Test Claude 5 in 5% of traffic. Don't announce."
        points: 5
        pattern: optionality-not-commitment
        rationale: |
          The right systems move. Builds the capability to switch without
          forcing the switch. Your eval pipeline now runs both models in
          parallel, you collect real user data on which performs better
          per use case, and if Claude 5 wins on substance you migrate in
          Q3 from a position of evidence not panic. Costs ~1 sprint of
          one engineer, doesn't burn the fundraise roadmap, keeps you
          honest with the SLA.
        consequence: |
          The abstraction ships in 8 days. Initial A/B shows Claude 5
          wins on instruction-following but loses on tone matching. You
          stay on GPT-4 in production, keep the option open, ship the
          fundraise on time.
        leadsTo: B-abstraction-followup
      - text: "Tell the team to ignore it. Stay heads-down on the fundraise roadmap. Revisit in Q3."
        points: 3
        pattern: focus-over-novelty
        rationale: |
          Discipline. Not wrong but leaves you blind. You preserve
          engineering focus on the roadmap, but you also don't learn
          whether Claude 5 actually beats GPT-4 on your specific use
          case. If a competitor ships on Claude 5 first and the press
          loves it, you're playing catch-up from zero. Defensible if
          your moat is real, dangerous if your moat is just "we were
          first."
        consequence: |
          Fundraise closes on time. A competitor ships Claude 5
          integration two weeks later and gets a TechCrunch headline.
          You spend Q3 explaining to enterprise prospects why you
          haven't migrated.
        leadsTo: C-ignore-followup

  A-migrate-followup:
    dimension: business
    prompt: |
      Mid-migration. Engineering says it'll take 2 more weeks than
      planned. Enterprise customer #1 (40% of revenue) emails saying
      their compliance team needs to re-audit because the model
      changed. Series A lead wants an update. What now?
    options:
      - text: "Push through. Tell the enterprise customer it's a one-time disruption."
        points: 1
        pattern: doubling-down-on-bad-call
        rationale: |
          Sunk cost talking. You're already two weeks late and asking the
          customer to absorb compliance pain to validate your model
          decision. The customer didn't ask for Claude 5; they asked for
          the product they bought. Pushing through preserves the
          decision but signals to enterprise that you don't respect
          their constraints.
        consequence: |
          Enterprise customer churns at renewal. Compliance team
          recommends switching to your competitor. Fundraise close
          slides further.
        leadsTo: end-A-bad
      - text: "Roll back. Document what you learned. Take the eval data into the next sprint."
        points: 4
        pattern: clean-rollback
        rationale: |
          Mature recovery. Admits the migration was premature, preserves
          the customer relationship, and turns the wasted sprint into
          learning fuel. Costs you 2 weeks of eng time but stops the
          bleeding. Lead investor will respect a clean rollback far
          more than a half-finished migration.
        consequence: |
          You roll back over a weekend. Lead investor: "Good call." The
          fundraise still closes 1 week late but on full terms.
        leadsTo: end-A-recovery
  end-A-bad:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      The hype-driven migration cost you the enterprise customer, the
      fundraise terms, and the team's trust in your ability to call
      shots under pressure. The product still runs, but the company is
      meaningfully weaker than it was on Monday morning.
  end-A-recovery:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      You recovered. The clean rollback bought you credibility you can
      spend later. The Series A closes a week late. You bake the
      model-abstraction layer into Q3 roadmap — the right move, just
      arrived at the wrong way.

  B-abstraction-followup:
    dimension: product
    prompt: |
      The abstraction is live. A/B running. Two weeks of data: Claude 5
      wins on instruction-following (12% better) and cost (40% cheaper),
      loses on tone-match for your support persona (8% worse on user
      sentiment). Enterprise customers have asked if you'll switch.
      What do you communicate publicly?
    options:
      - text: "Publish a blog post: 'We tested Claude 5 — here's what we learned.' Share the eval data."
        points: 5
        pattern: transparency-as-moat
        rationale: |
          The asymmetric move. You turn an operational decision into
          marketing. Enterprise customers see rigor; investors see
          systems thinking; AI Twitter sees a startup with real evals
          (rare). The post earns inbound from prospects who specifically
          want a partner who doesn't migrate on hype. Costs an afternoon
          of writing; pays off for months.
        consequence: |
          The post hits the front page of Hacker News. Three enterprise
          prospects email asking for demos. One says: "This is exactly
          why we wanted to work with you."
        leadsTo: end-B-great
      - text: "Stay quiet. Continue evals. Announce a migration only when the data is unambiguous."
        points: 4
        pattern: signal-over-noise
        rationale: |
          The disciplined move. Preserves optionality, avoids overcommitting
          publicly to a tradeoff that may shift. The cost: you forfeit
          the differentiation moment. If a competitor publishes a
          weaker version of the same analysis, they capture the
          narrative you sat on.
        consequence: |
          A competitor publishes a thinner eval comparison two weeks
          later and gets the press attention you could have had. Your
          eval is still better, but nobody knows.
        leadsTo: end-B-good
      - text: "Migrate to Claude 5 immediately. The cost savings will fund another engineer."
        points: 2
        pattern: cost-over-quality
        rationale: |
          Optimizing for the wrong axis. The 40% cost savings looks big
          on a spreadsheet, but your support product's value is in the
          tone-match (where Claude 5 loses). Trading 8% lower user
          sentiment for 40% lower COGS is bad math when you're at $1M
          ARR — that 8% becomes churn at renewal.
        consequence: |
          Cost drops, but NPS drops too. Two months later you're
          rebuilding the tone layer on top of Claude 5.
        leadsTo: end-B-mediocre
  end-B-great:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      The transparency post became one of the best marketing investments
      of the quarter. You stayed on GPT-4 in production but built a
      reputation as the AI startup that ships with evals, not hype.
      Series A closes on time, ahead of plan on terms.
  end-B-good:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      You shipped the disciplined move quietly. Fundraise closes on
      time. You missed the narrative moment, but the company is
      stronger and the option remains open for Q3.
  end-B-mediocre:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      The cost optimization came at the wrong price. NPS dropped,
      renewals slipped, and you spent Q3 rebuilding what GPT-4 was
      already doing right. Net-net you're behind where you started.

  C-ignore-followup:
    dimension: business
    prompt: |
      Eight weeks later, post-fundraise. A direct competitor (similar
      stage, smaller team) launched on Claude 5 with a public eval
      showing they outperform you on cost and instruction-following.
      Your inbound is down 30% MoM. Two enterprise prospects you were
      mid-cycle on went silent. What now?
    options:
      - text: "Build an abstraction now. Migrate carefully. Publish your own eval to reclaim narrative."
        points: 4
        pattern: late-but-correct
        rationale: |
          The right move, just two months late. You're now behind on the
          narrative but you can still recover. The eval-then-migrate
          path remains the rigorous one.
        consequence: |
          You recover the prospects over Q3. Inbound stabilizes. The
          competitor's lead shrinks but doesn't disappear.
        leadsTo: end-C-recover
      - text: "Counter-position: 'we don't chase model fashion.' Lean into stability messaging."
        points: 2
        pattern: defensive-positioning
        rationale: |
          A narrative gamble. Works if your customer base values
          stability over capability; fails if they're early-adopter
          enterprises who want the best model. In the support-AI
          category specifically, "stability" sounds like "behind."
        consequence: |
          The messaging splits your audience. Stability-buyers stay,
          frontier-buyers churn to the competitor. Net-net, ARR plateaus.
        leadsTo: end-C-defensive
  end-C-recover:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      You arrived at the right answer eventually. The two-month delay
      cost you narrative and some inbound, but the company is intact
      and the migration was clean.
  end-C-defensive:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      The "we don't chase fashion" framing protected your existing book
      but stopped your growth. The next 12 months become a defensive
      operation rather than an expansion.

## What's at stake here

This drill is based on a pattern playing out across every AI startup
in 2026: foundation-model providers releasing new generations every
quarter, founders pressured to migrate by Twitter velocity rather than
product evidence. The companies that build **model-abstraction layers
early** consistently outperform companies that either pivot on every
release or refuse to evaluate new models at all.

The deeper principle: optionality is cheap to build, expensive to
retrofit. Architect for model switching before you need to switch, then
let your evals — not the launch post — decide when.
