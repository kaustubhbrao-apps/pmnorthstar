principle: |
  Anchor pricing on the simplest number you can defend, and never
  optimize for short-term margin at the cost of long-term default-
  ness. Customers will eventually leave any vendor whose pricing
  feels predatory. Customers almost never leave a vendor whose
  pricing feels fair.
intro: |
  You are one of two co-founders of an early-stage payments
  infrastructure startup. You have a few hundred private-beta
  developers integrated, the product works, and you're about to make
  pricing public. Every competitor charges some combination of:
  setup fees ($500-2000), monthly minimums ($25-100), per-transaction
  rates (2.5-3.5%), per-transaction fixed fees ($0.20-0.50), and
  hidden line items (chargeback fees, currency conversion spreads,
  gateway fees).

  Your developers tell you they hate dealing with payments providers
  more than any other infrastructure in their stack — every quote
  comes with sales calls, every contract has surprises, every monthly
  statement is undecipherable. Your competitive advantage so far has
  been a clean API and 4-line integration. You need to decide the
  pricing now, before launch.
nodes:
  start:
    dimension: business
    prompt: |
      Pick the public pricing model.
    options:
      - text: "Match the market: 2.9% + 30¢ per transaction, $0 setup, $0 monthly, but require a contract"
        points: 4
        pattern: market-match-with-clarity
        rationale: |
          Defensible. You match the headline rate but eliminate the
          surprise fees competitors layer on. Customers can compare
          you straightforwardly. The contract requirement is the
          friction point — it slows down the developer self-service
          motion that's your advantage.
        consequence: |
          Conversion is solid but signups stall at the contract step.
          You add a 30-day pilot exception, then a 90-day exception,
          then eventually drop the contract entirely.
        leadsTo: A-match-followup
      - text: "Beat the market: 2.5% + 25¢. Aggressive pricing to win share."
        points: 2
        pattern: race-to-the-bottom
        rationale: |
          Dangerous. You're a venture-funded startup with negative
          unit economics on the lower rate (interchange + scheme
          fees alone eat 1.8-2.1%). Price wars in infrastructure are
          almost always won by the company with the deepest capital;
          undercutting now bakes in a margin problem that's painful
          to unwind later.
        consequence: |
          Volume comes in but you're losing money on every
          transaction. By month 9 you need to raise the rate, which
          breaks trust with the customers who signed for the lower
          number.
        leadsTo: end-B
      - text: "Match the headline rate (2.9% + 30¢) but no contract, no setup, no monthly, no hidden fees. Charge a higher rate for cards from outside the US."
        points: 5
        pattern: anchor-with-simplicity
        rationale: |
          The right call. You stop fighting on price and start fighting
          on clarity. 2.9% + 30¢ is the universal number — every
          developer already knows it. By stripping everything else
          (no setup, no monthly, no contract, no hidden fees), you
          turn pricing into a non-decision. Cross-border markup
          isolates the genuine cost without hiding it.
        consequence: |
          Conversion is high. Developers integrate the same afternoon
          they sign up. Word of mouth in dev communities compounds
          monthly. By the time competitors copy the model, you're
          the default.
        leadsTo: C-anchor-followup
      - text: "Tiered pricing — discounts for high-volume customers. 2.9% under $100K/month, 2.5% above."
        points: 3
        pattern: usage-tiers-too-early
        rationale: |
          Right model, wrong time. Tiered pricing makes sense once
          you have established customers asking for it; offering it
          out of the gate adds complexity to your pricing page and
          starts negotiation games early. Developers comparing you
          to competitors are now reading a pricing matrix instead
          of a single number.
        consequence: |
          Pricing page conversion drops because the matrix scares
          off small developers. You eventually flatten the pricing
          to remove the cognitive load.
        leadsTo: end-D
  A-match-followup:
    dimension: product
    prompt: |
      You launched with the contract requirement. Three months in,
      30% of signups bounce at the contract step. Conversion is
      mediocre. You need to decide what to do.
    options:
      - text: "Drop the contract. Anyone can sign up and start charging cards today."
        points: 5
        pattern: friction-removal
        rationale: |
          The right move. Every minute of friction between signup
          and live transaction costs you a developer who could have
          been an evangelist. Dropping the contract turns payments
          into infrastructure that ships in an afternoon. The
          fraud/abuse risk is real but addressable with limits
          and review tooling.
        consequence: |
          Signups jump 4x in the next quarter. Fraud doesn't
          spike materially because your limits hold. You become
          the "no contract, no setup" payments company.
        leadsTo: end-A-good
      - text: "Keep the contract but simplify it to a 1-page agreement."
        points: 3
        pattern: half-friction-removal
        rationale: |
          Better than the original but still friction. A simpler
          contract still requires reading, approval, and a signature.
          Self-serve developers won't tolerate it; you're optimizing
          for procurement teams at the cost of your actual ICP.
        consequence: |
          Bounce rate at the contract step drops from 30% to 20%.
          Better, but not where it needs to be.
        leadsTo: end-A-mediocre
  C-anchor-followup:
    dimension: product
    prompt: |
      Eighteen months in. The simple-pricing strategy worked.
      Enterprise prospects have started arriving with custom-pricing
      requests — high-volume merchants who want sub-2.9% rates.
      What do you do?
    options:
      - text: "Add an enterprise tier. Custom pricing above $1M monthly volume. Keep public pricing identical."
        points: 5
        pattern: tier-without-confusing
        rationale: |
          Correct. The public pricing remains the anchor (2.9% +
          30¢, no surprises) — that's the brand. Enterprise tier is
          quietly available at scale where the per-transaction
          economics shift. The customer who needs it knows to ask;
          the customer who doesn't never sees the menu.
        consequence: |
          Enterprise deals close at scale without contaminating the
          self-serve brand. ARR compounds from both directions.
        leadsTo: end-C-great
      - text: "Publish a volume-discount table on the pricing page."
        points: 3
        pattern: pricing-page-bloat
        rationale: |
          The transparency instinct, misapplied. Your strongest brand
          asset is "the pricing page that has one number." Publishing
          a discount table replaces the one-number simplicity with a
          matrix every prospect has to interpret. You'd be
          re-introducing the cognitive load you eliminated.
        consequence: |
          The pricing page becomes a comparison exercise. Sales
          cycles for enterprise improve slightly; the self-serve
          conversion drops a hair. Net mixed.
        leadsTo: end-C-mixed
      - text: "Refuse to negotiate. Same price for everyone."
        points: 2
        pattern: fairness-as-dogma
        rationale: |
          Principled but loses revenue. At enterprise volume the
          per-transaction economics genuinely allow lower rates;
          refusing them on principle leaves dollars on the table
          and pushes large merchants toward competitors who will
          negotiate.
        consequence: |
          You lose three large prospects to a competitor over the
          next two quarters. The brand stays clean but ARR plateaus
          at the upper end.
        leadsTo: end-C-mixed
  end-A-good:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      The contract drop unlocked the self-serve motion. Within a year
      you were the default payments provider for early-stage
      startups, and the brand was set: payments infrastructure that
      ships in an afternoon.
  end-A-mediocre:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      The simplified contract softened the friction but didn't
      eliminate it. You shipped a competent payments product but
      gave up the self-serve narrative to a competitor who removed
      the contract entirely.
  end-B:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      Aggressive pricing built volume but broke unit economics. The
      Series A round priced lower because reviewers saw the margin
      issue. The next 18 months were spent quietly raising prices
      and apologizing to early customers.
  end-C-great:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      The simple-pricing-plus-enterprise-quiet-tier model became the
      textbook for infrastructure pricing. The pricing page
      ("2.9% + 30¢. No setup, no monthly, no hidden fees.") became
      a recruiting tool for both customers and engineers.
  end-C-mixed:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      The pricing page got cluttered (or stayed principled but lost
      revenue). The product still grew but you traded the cleanest
      brand asset you had for marginal optimization.
  end-D:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      Tiered pricing was the right model in year 3, not year 1. You
      eventually flattened the pricing to recover the self-serve
      motion, but the matrix had already cost you ~6 months of
      conversion gains.

## What actually happened

This drill is based on **Stripe's pricing decisions from 2010-2011**.
Patrick and John Collison launched Stripe with **2.9% + 30¢, no
setup, no monthly, no hidden fees, no contract** — at a time when
payments providers universally required contracts, setup fees, and
monthly minimums.

The clean number became Stripe's most-recognized brand asset.
Developers could compare any competitor by counting how many
asterisks were on the pricing page. Stripe had none.

Enterprise tiers came later, quietly, for merchants with
substantial volume — but the headline number on
**stripe.com/pricing** stayed the same. The pricing page itself
became one of the most-imitated artifacts in SaaS pricing.

Stripe went on to a **$95B valuation** at its peak, and the
"infrastructure pricing should be one number" pattern is now the
default for new developer-tool companies (Vercel, Plaid, Twilio,
Cloudflare).
