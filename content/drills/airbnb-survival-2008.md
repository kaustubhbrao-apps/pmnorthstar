  When you're out of runway with no PMF, don't optimize for cash — optimize
  for inventory quality and conversion lift. The cheapest path forward is
  almost never the right one. Founders who do things that don't scale to
  fix the actual conversion problem buy themselves the right to scale later;
  founders who cut costs to extend runway just push the same problem six
  months down the road with even less leverage.
intro: |
  You are one of three co-founders of a year-old marketplace startup. The
  product lets travellers pay to stay in strangers' spare rooms or on their
  couches — verified hosts, verified guests, your platform handles the
  bookings and takes a cut. Two of you are designers; the third is the
  engineer who rejoined the team two months ago after a brief detour at
  another company.

  The numbers are bleak. Roughly 1,000 listings have been live for the
  last six months — growth has flatlined. Bookings are rounding to zero.
  The three of you together carry about $40,000 in personal credit-card
  debt that has been funding the company. You've been sleeping on
  couches yourselves. Every investor you've pitched in the last six
  months has passed; most dismiss the idea outright as "weird" or
  "people-won't-actually-do-this."

  One real opportunity remains. You have an interview in two weeks with
  the lead partner at the most prestigious accelerator in the country —
  the one whose YES check is worth $20K of seed cash, three months of
  intensive mentorship, and access to the investor network that decides
  what gets funded next year. It is, candidly, your last realistic shot
  at not winding down.

  Sitting at the kitchen table of the apartment you can no longer afford,
  you need to decide what to do in the 14 days before that interview.
nodes:
  start:
    dimension: founder
    prompt: |
      The accelerator interview is in 14 days. Listings are flat, revenue
      is zero, credit cards are maxed. Pick your move.
    options:
      - text: Pivot to a price-comparison aggregator on top of existing public hotel inventory
        points: 0
        pattern: defensive-cashflow
        rationale: |
          The defensible instinct in this seat. Public hotel inventory is
          available via affiliate APIs; you could ship a working
          comparison engine in 30 days and start earning small affiliate
          commissions immediately. The cash flow is real today. The
          problem: you're choosing to compete with already-public,
          venture-funded comparison sites that have 1000x your capital and
          existing distribution. The marketplace network you've spent a
          year building — the unfair advantage that makes this venture
          possible — gets discarded for incremental margin on someone
          else's inventory. Short-term cash bought, long-term irrelevance
          locked in.
        consequence: |
          Within 90 days you're a fifth-place competitor in a category
          dominated by public companies. Burn outpaces affiliate revenue
          5:1. Investors stop returning calls.

      - text: Cut everything to your highest-density city. Personally fly out and photograph every host's listing.
        points: 10
        pattern: do-things-that-dont-scale
        rationale: |
          The move that doesn't look like a strategy in any deck. Listings
          with phone-camera snapshots convert at roughly 0.3%; the same
          listings with professionally-staged photos convert at roughly
          1.8%. The bet: density in one city beats breadth across many,
          and the cheapest way to test it is to fix the conversion problem
          yourself, by hand, one apartment at a time. Risks: founder time
          is the most expensive thing in a startup, and you're spending it
          on something that doesn't scale by definition. Worth it because
          the conversion data is the only proof point an investor can
          touch — and you have nothing else.
        consequence: |
          Three weeks of personal photoshoots later, conversion in your
          chosen city is up roughly 30%. You have a story the accelerator
          partner can listen to.

      - text: Manufacture a limited-edition novelty product tied to a major upcoming public event. Sell to enthusiasts and press for cash + attention.
        points: 10
        pattern: survival-as-press
        rationale: |
          The cockroach move. There's a major public event with intense
          public attention coming up in the next four weeks. You can
          design, manufacture, and sell a quirky themed product (it has
          nothing to do with your core marketplace) to event-obsessed
          enthusiasts. It's not a real business — it's a story that gets
          you press coverage, gets you cash, and signals to the accelerator
          partner that you are the kind of founder who solves problems
          creatively rather than wait for permission. Risk: it looks like
          a distraction from the core product. Payoff: the resulting story
          becomes a founder-quality signal that compounds into investor
          mythology for the next decade.
        consequence: |
          The novelty product sells out, you clear $30,000, and the press
          coverage gets the accelerator partner's attention. He says: "If
          you can convince people to pay $40 for $4 of [your product],
          you can convince them to do anything." The interview suddenly
          matters again.

      - text: Treat the accelerator interview as the last try. Shut down honestly if it fails.
        points: 4
        pattern: defensive-shutdown
        rationale: |
          The honest assessment after a year of grinding. The data says
          this isn't working; the rational move is to cut losses, save
          credit scores, and try again with a different idea. The right
          observation is brutal but accurate: most startups die because
          founders refuse to quit, and "persevere through anything" is
          survivorship bias dressed up as wisdom. The wrong part:
          you haven't yet exhausted the cheapest experiments (photography,
          novelty product, in-person hustle) that might actually move the
          data in the 14 days you have. You're capitulating before you've
          actually tried the things that don't require permission or
          capital.
        consequence: |
          You go to the interview with no new traction. The partner is
          polite but unconvinced. He suggests you find a co-founder with
          more product experience. The company quietly winds down by
          November.
        leadsTo: D-yc-2
  B-photos-2:
    dimension: product
    prompt: |
      Three weeks later. You've personally shot 40 listings in your chosen
      city. Conversion is up about 30% there, and the photos make the
      product look like a real marketplace for the first time. The
      accelerator interview is in 7 days. The lead partner, sitting
      across the table at the screening dinner, asks the question every
      experienced investor asks: "Why won't this work?"

      What's your answer?
    options:
      - text: We're filling a gap hotels can't — short-term, unique inventory in places hotels don't exist
        points: 10
        pattern: positioning-by-negative-space
        rationale: |
          The correct framing. You are not competing with hotels; you are
          serving the demand hotels structurally cannot serve — week-long
          stays in residential neighbourhoods, unique spaces, groups
          travelling together, budget-conscious travel. This positioning
          makes you a category creator, not a category challenger. It also
          gives the investor a clean mental model: "they own the long-tail
          of travel accommodation," which is a fundable narrative.
          Experienced investors specifically reward founders who can name
          the negative space their product owns; founders who frame
          themselves as "a better X" usually lose.
        consequence: |
          The partner nods slowly. "OK. Come Tuesday." You're in the
          accelerator.
        leadsTo: B-photos-3
      - text: Hosts love it. We just need money to scale the photography across cities.
        points: 6
        pattern: ops-as-strategy
        rationale: |
          This is real and true but it's the wrong answer to the question
          asked. The partner didn't ask "what would help you grow?"; he
          asked "why won't this work?" Answering with an operational ask
          signals that you think the only barrier is capital, which makes
          you sound like you've stopped thinking about why the marketplace
          itself might fail. Experienced investors look for founders who
          can articulate their own failure modes; founders who only have
          success stories haven't pressure-tested their own thesis. This
          answer gets you in but on weaker terms — the partner remembers
          the answer that didn't grapple with the question.
        consequence: |
          The partner looks unconvinced. "You need to think more about why
          your users might not come back, not just how to get more of
          them." You're in, but on probation.
        leadsTo: B-photos-3
      - text: We have one city working. We just need to copy it everywhere.
        points: 2
        pattern: scaling-without-pmf
        rationale: |
          The most dangerous answer. You haven't yet proven that one city
          works as a sustained habit — you've proven that one city works
          as a one-time conversion event after a founder's manual
          intervention. Premature scaling is the single most common cause
          of startup death. Experienced investors specifically watch for
          this signal — founders who confuse "early traction" with "we
          have product-market fit" tend to burn the next round of capital
          copy-pasting a strategy that wasn't validated. Answering this
          way tells the partner you don't understand your own data.
        consequence: |
          The partner: "You're not solving a problem. You're scaling a
          solution looking for a problem." You're not accepted. The team
          regroups.

  B-photos-3:
    dimension: product
    prompt: |
      You're three weeks into the accelerator. Demo Day is 9 weeks away.
      Bookings in your first city are growing about 40% month over month,
      but you've launched in a second city and the curve is flat. Each of
      your three co-founders has a different theory about what to push
      next. You can only afford to back one.
    options:
      - text: 'Co-founder A (the visionary): international expansion. Three more cities across continents, photographers in each.'
        points: 2
        pattern: premature-internationalization
        rationale: |
          The visionary's instinct is "if one city worked, more cities =
          more growth." The hidden assumption: that the first city's
          growth was caused by the city, not by the founder grind that
          made the first city work. Going international means scaling the
          *cost* of the strategy (international photographers, time zones,
          travel logistics) before scaling the *substance* (a self-serve
          mechanism for the conversion lift). Most founders who chase
          premature expansion run out of money before any new city shows
          PMF. The right time to go international is when domestic density
          has proven the unit economics actually compound — and yours
          haven't yet.
        consequence: |
          You burn $200K on photographers across three continents.
          Listings grow modestly. The visionary lives on flights. The
          founder team starts to fray.
        leadsTo: B-end
      - text: 'Co-founder B (the operator): domestic density first. Saturate city one, then two, then three, then four — methodically.'
        points: 10
        pattern: density-before-breadth
        rationale: |
          The correct call. Marketplaces are local — supply and demand
          have to match in the same geography for transactions to happen.
          Your first city works because there is enough supply (hosts)
          AND enough demand (travellers) in the same place. Adding cities
          one at a time, saturating each before moving on, gives the
          marketplace flywheel a chance to compound. The math is brutal
          in retrospect: a marketplace at 80% saturation in 5 cities is
          worth more than one at 5% saturation in 50 cities. This is the
          principle every marketplace founder learns the hard way.
        consequence: |
          You saturate city one, then two, then three, then four in six
          months. By Demo Day, you're at $200K monthly bookings and a
          tier-one fund is leading the seed.

      - text: 'Co-founder C (the engineer): build a referral mechanic so existing users bring more'
        points: 6
        pattern: referrals-before-love
        rationale: |
          Right direction, wrong moment. Referral mechanics work when
          users love the product enough to invite others; you don't yet
          have a user base that meets that bar. Building referrals now
          means investing engineering time on a growth lever before you've
          proven the underlying product has the love that makes referrals
          work. Six months later this becomes the right call — referrals
          eventually become one of your best-documented growth loops —
          but right now, it's a distraction from fixing the supply-demand
          matching that hasn't yet clicked. The engineer is right about
          the lever; he's wrong about the timing.
        consequence: |
          The referral system ships, but only 3% of users invite anyone.
          Data is too thin to be useful. You wasted three weeks of
          engineering time on a lever that wasn't yet ready.
        leadsTo: B-end
  B-end:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      The operator's density strategy, combined with the photography hack
      and the novelty-product play, became your actual path. You saturated
      one city, then the next, then the next before going international.
      Demo Day arrives with 40% month-over-month growth and a tier-one
      fund leads the seed round. The photography hack becomes a permanent
      operational arm of the company. The novelty-product story becomes
      founder folklore — proof that founder-quality signals can carry a
      thesis when the metrics don't yet.
  A-hotels-2:
    dimension: business
    prompt: |
      Six months into the pivot. You're now a hotel-price-comparison
      engine. You have around 50,000 monthly visitors and $3,000/month in
      affiliate revenue. Burn is $25,000/month. A public comparison
      competitor just raised $200M. What do you do?
    options:
      - text: Stay the course. More marketing. Better SEO.
        points: 2
        pattern: sunk-cost-doubling-down
        rationale: |
          The instinct is to push harder on a strategy you've committed to
          — sunk-cost fallacy at its purest. The data is already telling
          you the strategy is structurally broken: you're competing on
          the same axis (price comparison) as a public competitor with
          1000x your capital, and the gap compounds. More marketing on
          top of a losing unit-economics model accelerates the end, it
          doesn't change it. Founders pick this option because quitting
          the pivot means admitting the pivot itself was the mistake.
        consequence: |
          $200K of marketing burn over four months. Affiliate revenue grows
          to $8K/month. Burn outpaces revenue 5:1. Runway hits zero.
        leadsTo: A-end-bad
      - text: Layer marketplace features back on top — let users list short-term rentals through us
        points: 6
        pattern: hidden-pivot-back
        rationale: |
          A graceful way to admit the pivot was wrong without saying so —
          quietly add the original marketplace functionality back on top
          of the hotel-aggregator brand. You preserve the brand but you're
          trying to capture the marketplace upside you abandoned. Risk:
          investors see through it, and the brand confusion ("are we a
          hotel comparison site or a rental marketplace?") kills the
          positioning that made either option viable. Honest pivots win;
          half-pivots leave you stuck between two markets.
        consequence: |
          The hybrid product confuses users. Hotel-search regulars don't
          understand the rental listings; rental hosts don't trust a
          hotel brand. You're stuck.
        leadsTo: A-end-mediocre
      - text: Admit the pivot was wrong. Pivot back to the marketplace, rebrand.
        points: 10
        pattern: pivot-back-with-clarity
        rationale: |
          The hardest move emotionally, the right move strategically. You
          pivoted away from your unfair advantage (the marketplace network
          and brand you'd been building) to chase a market you can't win.
          Admitting it now is cheaper than admitting it in six months.
          The pivot-back option also has a historical precedent: every
          major marketplace company has had at least one near-death pivot
          moment. The founders who recovered were the ones who recognised
          the original thesis was correct and the detour was the mistake.
        consequence: |
          You spend three months rebuilding the marketplace product and
          re-onboarding hosts. By month 9 you're back where Branch B would
          have put you in month 3 — but you've lost six months and $200K.
          Catch-up is possible but expensive.

  A-end-bad:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      You burned the runway competing in a category you couldn't win.
      Without a marketplace moat, you had no story for investors. The

      there's nothing left to pitch.
  A-end-mediocre:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      The hybrid product muddles along for 18 months. You raise a small
      friends-and-family round but no institutional money. By the time
      the marketplace category breaks out, a different team owns it.
      You sell to a competitor for a small acqui-hire price.
  A-end-recovery:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      You recover. The marketplace is rebuilt and growing by month 12,
      but you're 18 months behind where a clean execution would have put
      you. The tier-one fund check goes to a different team that didn't
      detour. The detour cost you a category-defining position; the
      company survives but smaller.
  C-cereal-2:
    dimension: founder
    prompt: |
      The novelty product sold out. $30K is in the bank. Credit-card debt
      is cleared. The accelerator partner invited you back to a closed-
      door dinner specifically because of the press the novelty product
      generated. The dinner is in 5 days. The cash buys you another 3
      months of runway. What's your pitch angle?
    options:
      - text: The novelty product is the proof — we're founders who don't quit, and that's the bet
        points: 10
        pattern: founder-thesis
        rationale: |
          The right angle. The partner explicitly told you why the novelty
          product mattered: it was a founder-quality signal, not a product
          proof. The pitch that aligns with the partner's stated reason
          for inviting you back is the pitch that earns the check.
          Founders who try to pivot away from their origin story toward
          "real metrics" miss the entire point — at seed stage, investors
          aren't betting on the marketplace yet; they're betting on the
          people who built it.
        consequence: |
          The partner smiles. "Right answer. Welcome to the batch."

        points: 4
        pattern: distance-from-the-story
        rationale: |
          The instinct to be taken seriously. You don't want to be the
          "novelty product founders," you want to be the "real startup
          founders." The problem: the novelty product *is* the
          marketplace traction proof, because the marketplace doesn't yet
          have any. By distancing yourself from the story that earned
          you this seat, you're throwing away the one differentiating
          signal you have. Founders who try to pivot away from their
          origin story often pick the wrong angle for their first
          investor pitches — investors aren't buying the metrics, they're
          buying the people.
        consequence: |
          The partner is polite but not enthusiastic. "I liked the
          novelty angle. Why are you running from it?" You're in, but
          mentally downgraded.

        points: 6
        pattern: feature-roadmap-pitch
        rationale: |
          A reasonable but unimaginative answer. You acknowledge the
          novelty product (good) and frame the accelerator capital as the
          next chapter (good), but you anchor the next chapter on
          features rather than on a hypothesis about the marketplace. At
          seed stage, features aren't a thesis — they're tactics. The
          pitch the partner is actually looking for is: "here's the
          wedge we're testing, here's how we'll know if it works, here's
          why the novelty proves we can." Feature-list pitches lose to
          thesis pitches every time.
        consequence: |
          You're accepted but with measured enthusiasm. You're in, but

          The correct call. The guest is making a binary decision (book
          or don't), already pulling out their wallet, and emotionally
          committed — adding a small fee at the moment of purchase has
          minimal friction. The host has options: list elsewhere or not
          at all. The best marketplaces charge the side with fewer
          alternatives (the "mobile" side), not the side with many (the
          "entrenched" side). This is the take-rate pattern that became
          the textbook marketplace pricing strategy.
        consequence: |
          Revenue grows from $0 to $40K/month in two months. Hosts are
          happy because their take is unchanged. Demo Day investors love
          the unit-economics story.

        points: 4
        pattern: tax-the-supply-side
        rationale: |
          The intuitive but wrong call. Hosts seem like the easier party
          to tax — they're getting paid; the fee just reduces their take.
          Hidden problem: hosts have alternatives (other listing sites,
          their own networks, just not renting) and they're the side
          that's harder to acquire. If you tax the side you're still
          trying to grow, you slow your supply growth at the exact moment
          supply is your constraint. The unit economics look fine on
          paper but the marketplace stops compounding.
        consequence: |
          Host signups slow by 40%. The marketplace grows slower than
          forecast. Demo Day investors are unimpressed with the supply
          numbers.

        points: 2
        pattern: defer-revenue-trap
        rationale: |
          The Silicon Valley orthodoxy — "grow first, monetize later" —
          applied at exactly the wrong moment. You're not a social
          network with unlimited venture money and a clear platform
          endgame; you're a marketplace with 8 weeks until Demo Day and
          no revenue story. Deferring monetization in this seat means
          going to Demo Day with "growth at all costs" as your only
          narrative — a hard sell in any cautious capital environment.
          Marketplaces especially need to prove unit economics early
          because variable cost structure *is* the business.
        consequence: |
          Demo Day investors ask: "How will you ever make money?" You
          don't have a clear answer. The seed round closes at half what
          it should have, on bad terms.

  C-end:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      The novelty-product money + accelerator + guest-side service fee
      became your trajectory. The 9% take rate on the guest side became
      the textbook marketplace pricing model. The novelty-product story
      became startup folklore — proof that founder-quality signals can
      carry a thesis when the metrics don't yet.
  D-yc-2:
    dimension: founder
    prompt: |
      The accelerator partner passed. You have $0 in the bank, no
      co-founder who wants to keep going, no traction. One of the
      designers wants to try one more thing. The other is leaning toward
      going back to consulting. The engineer is silent. What's the move?

      - text: Shut down honestly. File the paperwork, settle the credit cards over 5 years.
        points: 6
        pattern: clean-shutdown
        rationale: |
          The mature move. You tried, it didn't work, and dragging the
          corpse through another quarter only buries you in more debt.
          The honest shutdown preserves your reputation and energy for
          the next venture. The cost: you'll spend the next decade
          wondering whether one more iteration would have changed
          everything. Many founders pick this option and go on to build
          successful second companies; this specific opportunity gets
          captured by someone else.
        consequence: |
          You shut down within three months. The marketplace opportunity
          is eventually captured by a different team 3-4 years later.
          You watch them succeed and try not to think about it.
        leadsTo: D-end
      - text: One more month of grinding. If nothing changes, then shut down.
        points: 8
        pattern: defined-stop-loss
        rationale: |
          The defensible middle path. You give yourselves a defined
          window to try one specific experiment. The discipline of a
          defined stop-loss is what separates persistence from delusion.
          If you'd phrased the original branch as "give ourselves 30
          days to try the unscalable hacks and re-evaluate," you'd be on
          the path that actually worked. Risk: founders who set "one
          more month" often extend three more times. Benefit: you allow
          yourselves the chance to find the breakthrough.
        consequence: |
          You try the novelty product and the photography hack within the
          month. Both work. You re-apply to the next batch with the new
          story. You're accepted. The trajectory recovers, just a year
          later.

      - text: Pivot the team — keep the company alive but as a design consultancy
        points: 4
        pattern: zombie-company
        rationale: |
          The worst of both worlds. You keep the company nominally alive
          but stop trying to build the marketplace. The two designers
          could earn consulting revenue, but a "design consultancy that
          used to be a marketplace" is a brand that confuses everyone —
          clients, investors, the team itself. The thing you're
          optimising for (preserving the option of restarting later)
          almost never happens; in practice, the company becomes a slow-
          burn zombie that takes years to formally shut down.
        consequence: |
          The consultancy earns $80K in its first year. The marketplace
          dream is shelved. Years later, the opportunity is gone. The
          team eventually drifts apart.
        leadsTo: D-end
  D-end:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      The path you didn't take — but a real path many founders take. The
      company almost died here. The "one more month with specific
      experiments" mentality is what separates the company that survives
      from the company that doesn't. Most founders quit a month too
      early; a few quit a month too late. The skill is knowing which
      mode you're in.
  B-end-no-yc:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      You fumbled the partner's question and didn't get in. Without the
      seed and network, the marketplace couldn't get past the chicken-
      egg problem. The company quietly wound down. The opportunity got
      captured by a different team a few years later.

## What actually happened — the reveal

This drill is based on the real 2008 decisions faced by **Brian Chesky,
Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk** at the company that became **AirBnB**.

In August 2008, AirBnB (then called AirBed & Breakfast) was 12 months
old, with stagnant listings, $40,000 in personal credit-card debt across
the three co-founders, and most VCs dismissing the idea as "people
sleeping on air mattresses in strangers' apartments." Y Combinator's
W09 batch interview was their last realistic shot.

**They chose Branch B and Branch C in parallel.** They flew to New York
(their highest-density city), photographed every host's apartment
themselves with a borrowed DSLR, and watched conversion lift roughly
30%. At the same time, with the U.S. presidential election approaching,
they designed and manufactured two limited-edition cereals — *Obama O's*
("The Breakfast of Change") and *Cap'n McCain's* ("A Maverick in Every
Bite") — and sold them at the Democratic and Republican National
Conventions for $40 a box.

The cereal sold out and brought in roughly **$30,000** — clearing the
credit-card debt and buying three more months of runway. Paul Graham
heard about the cereal from another founder and reportedly told them:
*"If you can convince people to pay $40 for $4 of cereal, you can
probably convince them to sleep on air mattresses in strangers'
apartments."*

They were accepted into Y Combinator's W09 batch.

Inside YC, they followed Joe Gebbia's instinct on **U.S. density first**
— saturating New York, then Brian's home city of San Francisco, then
Boston, then Los Angeles before any international expansion. Bookings
grew roughly **40% month-over-month** for the first year inside YC. The
**9% guest-side service fee**, set during YC, became the company's
permanent take rate and the textbook marketplace pricing model.

By Demo Day 2009, AirBnB was profitable on a per-booking basis. Sequoia
Capital led the seed round at a **$2.4M valuation**. AirBnB hit a
**$30M valuation** at Series A in 2010, **$1B** in 2011, and a **$30B
IPO** in 2020.

The cereal hack became the most-told founder story in startup history —
proof that founder-quality signals can carry a thesis when the metrics
don't yet. The New York photography hustle became a permanent
operational arm of the company (AirBnB Plus, professional photography
for hosts).
