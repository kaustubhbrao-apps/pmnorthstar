  The worst time to pivot is mid-fundraise. The second-worst time
  is to not pivot when you know you should and let investors fund
  a thesis you no longer believe. Honest mid-process recalibration —
  done quickly — costs the deal less than dishonest closure.
intro: |
  You are the CEO of a Series-A-stage AI startup, mid-process on a
  $15M round. Term sheet from a tier-one lead is signed but not
  closed; another investor is finalizing diligence. The round
  thesis is: "AI agent for sales SDR workflows."

  Three weeks ago, you ran an internal eval that showed your
  product works dramatically better when deployed to customer-
  success teams (retention, expansion, churn prevention) than to
  sales SDRs. CS users have 4x the engagement, 6x the retention,
  and the unit economics are 3x better. Two of your design partners
  have already asked to repurpose the product for CS.

  The lead investor's thesis was specifically the SDR market. Your
  CFO is telling you to close the round on the SDR narrative and
  pivot quietly after the cash is in. Your VP Product is telling
  you the opposite.
nodes:
  start:
    dimension: founder
    prompt: |
      $15M is two weeks from close. Pick the move.
    options:
      - text: "Close on the SDR thesis. Pivot to CS once the money's in the bank."
        points: 0
        pattern: deceive-the-investor
        rationale: |
          Catastrophic call. Sophisticated lead investors do reference
          checks during the funding-source's standard 90-day window
          after close; if your pivot becomes obvious in those 90 days,
          the round can unwind, you can be replaced as CEO, and you
          earn a permanent reputation in the VC network. The short-
          term cash gain is dwarfed by the long-term reputational cost.
        consequence: |
          You close. Two months in, the pivot becomes obvious in your
          quarterly investor update. The lead investor is furious.
          They don't pull the money (legally hard) but they pull
          their network and references. The Series B becomes
          essentially impossible.
        leadsTo: end-A
      - text: "Tell the lead investor now. Be honest. Offer to re-paper the round on the CS thesis at the same terms, or release them."
        points: 5
        pattern: honest-recalibration
        rationale: |
          The mature move. Sophisticated investors respect founders
          who recalibrate based on data more than founders who
          close on a wrong thesis. You're giving the lead the
          option to lean in on the new thesis (often they will,
          because the new data is stronger) or to step out gracefully
          (preserving the relationship for future deals). The
          short-term pain is real; the long-term reputation is
          asymmetric.
        consequence: |
          The lead takes 4 days to decide. They come back enthusiastic
          about the CS pivot, ask for board-level governance on the
          new thesis, and close on revised terms. The other investor
          also signs. Round closes 3 weeks late on stronger terms.
        leadsTo: B-honest-followup
      - text: "Delay the close — tell the lead 'we need 6 weeks more time' without explaining why."
        points: 2
        pattern: stall-without-honesty
        rationale: |
          Defers the problem without solving it. The lead will know
          something is off (founders don't randomly delay funded
          rounds) and will spend the 6 weeks investigating. By the
          time you have to explain, you've also damaged trust
          on top of the original issue.
        consequence: |
          The lead pulls back during the delay, citing "lack of
          urgency." The other investor follows. You restart
          fundraising 3 months later on weaker terms.
        leadsTo: end-C
      - text: "Withdraw the round entirely. Bootstrap on revenue until the CS thesis is unambiguous."
        points: 3
        pattern: walk-away-from-money
        rationale: |
          Honorable but expensive. Walking away from $15M to avoid a
          difficult conversation costs you growth capital you may
          not be able to recover in this market. If the CS thesis
          is strong, investors will still fund it — but you've
          forfeited 12-18 months of runway to make the point.
        consequence: |
          You withdraw. Revenue compounds slowly. You raise a
          smaller round 9 months later on the CS thesis, at a
          slightly lower valuation than the original SDR terms
          would have produced.
        leadsTo: end-D
  B-honest-followup:
    dimension: business
    prompt: |
      The round closed on the CS pivot. The lead investor is on the
      board and asks for a clear 90-day plan to validate the CS
      market. You have two design partners. Pick the plan.
    options:
      - text: "Sign 5 more design partners in CS. Free, with monthly QBRs and product co-design rights."
        points: 5
        pattern: validation-velocity
        rationale: |
          Right early-stage move. Five design partners across
          different industries = enough signal to confirm or
          deny the thesis within the 90-day window. Free
          eliminates buying-friction at the validation stage.
          Co-design rights buy you the depth of feedback that
          paid customers won't give.
        consequence: |
          All 5 signed within 30 days. Three of them convert to
          paid contracts at month 4. The 90-day plan exceeds
          target. Board confidence is reinforced.
        leadsTo: end-B-great
      - text: "Charge enterprise prices from day one — $50K/year. Filter for serious customers."
        points: 3
        pattern: premium-pricing-pre-validation
        rationale: |
          Defensible to fund the team but premature to charge
          before the product-market fit is unambiguous. At
          validation stage, the goal is signal, not revenue;
          charging enterprise rates filters out the wrong-fit
          early adopters who give the best feedback.
        consequence: |
          You sign 1 enterprise customer at $50K. The feedback loop
          is slow because there's only one data point. The 90-day
          validation plan is partially met.
        leadsTo: end-B-mixed
      - text: "Run a public beta. Let any CS team sign up free. Maximize sample size."
        points: 2
        pattern: spray-and-pray
        rationale: |
          Volume without depth. Public beta with no qualification
          produces noisy signal — most signups won't be your ICP
          and won't engage seriously. You'd spend the validation
          window supporting users who never had real intent.
        consequence: |
          5,000 signups in 60 days, but only ~80 are real CS
          teams and only ~10 use the product weekly. Validation
          signal is muddy. Lead investor asks for a sharper plan.
        leadsTo: end-B-mediocre
  end-A:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      The deception broke the relationship with the lead investor
      and broadcast in the VC network. The Series B was impossible
      on those terms. The company eventually raised on weaker terms
      from a different syndicate, after a leadership transition.
  end-B-great:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      The honest recalibration plus tight validation plan worked.
      The CS pivot validated within 90 days, the Series B closed
      18 months later at 5x the Series A valuation. The board
      relationship became one of the strongest assets of the
      company.
  end-B-mixed:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      The pivot worked but the premium pricing slowed validation.
      Series B happened but on weaker terms than a tighter
      validation plan would have produced.
  end-B-mediocre:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      The public beta produced noise. The 90-day plan missed
      target. Board confidence wavered. The company recovered
      with a sharper plan in month 4 but lost momentum.
  end-C:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      The delay broke trust without resolving the underlying issue.
      The lead pulled out, the round restarted 3 months later on
      weaker terms with a different syndicate.
  end-D:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      Walking away cost you 9-12 months of growth capital. The
      eventual smaller round closed but the team lost two senior
      hires you couldn't afford during the bootstrap window.

## What's at stake here

Mid-fundraise pivots happen more often than founders publicly
admit. The pattern that consistently wins: **honest recalibration
told to the lead before close.** Sophisticated investors fund
people, not theses, and a founder who recalibrates on data is more
fundable on the *new* thesis than a founder who closes on the *old*
one and pivots later.

The failure mode that consistently destroys companies: deceiving
the investor through close. Cap table sophistication catches it
within a quarter, and the reputational cost compounds for years.
