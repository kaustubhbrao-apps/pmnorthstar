principle: |
  The most defensible early moat in a commodity market is exclusion.
  When you let everyone in, you compete on price; when you let only
  the top decile in, you compete on aspiration. Aspirational markets
  compound on brand, not features.
intro: |
  You are the founder of a new fintech startup in India. Your product
  helps users manage credit card payments — pay all your cards on time
  through one app, with rewards on each payment. Credit card payment
  reminders aren't novel; HDFC Bank, ICICI, and Paytm all offer the
  feature. Your reward structure is interesting but copyable.

  India has ~80M credit card holders in 2018, but the active
  card-using population is much smaller — roughly 8M people who carry
  premium cards and spend significantly. These users are
  underserved: existing payment apps treat them the same as the
  broader population, with the same UX and same rewards.

  You've raised $30M from tier-one investors. The team wants to
  launch broadly. Your co-founder wants to launch invitation-only,
  gated to users with CIBIL credit scores above 750.
nodes:
  start:
    dimension: business
    prompt: |
      Launch broadly to all credit-card holders, or gate by credit
      score?
    options:
      - text: Launch invitation-only. Gate to credit scores 750+. Aspirational positioning.
        points: 15
        pattern: exclusion-as-positioning
        rationale: |
          The contrarian move that turns a commodity product into an
          aspirational one. You're not selling "pay your bills"; you're
          selling "you're in the top decile, here's an app for people
          like you." Brand-wise, this is dramatically more defensible
          than a feature-equivalent broad launch. The risk: smaller
          initial TAM, slower growth at the top of the funnel. The
          payoff: every user who gets in becomes an evangelist
          because being in confers status.
        consequence: |
          You launch invitation-only with elaborate design and the
          750+ gate. Wait-list grows to 100K in three months. The
          first wave of users posts screenshots of their "Welcome to
          CRED" interface across Instagram and LinkedIn. Brand becomes
          aspirational overnight.
        leadsTo: B-exclusion-followup
      - text: Launch broadly. Reach every credit-card holder in India. Compete on rewards.
        points: 3
        pattern: tam-first-thinking
        rationale: |
          The growth-instinct call. Maximum reach, maximum TAM,
          aggressive rewards spend. Problem: in a commoditizing market
          where Paytm and bank apps already offer reminders + small
          rewards, you'd be competing for the same user on the same
          axis (rewards $) with deeper-pocketed incumbents. You'd burn
          $30M on subsidies without a brand moat.
        consequence: |
          Initial signups are strong but conversion costs are high.
          Existing apps match your reward structure within 4 months.
          You burn most of the round on rewards subsidies. Brand
          looks like another payments app.
        leadsTo: end-A
      - text: Launch broadly but use beautiful design + premium UI to differentiate.
        points: 9
        pattern: design-without-exclusion
        rationale: |
          Right instinct on premium feel, wrong execution on access.
          Beautiful UI without exclusivity reads as "well-designed
          but for everyone" — which doesn't compound the aspirational
          brand. The status signal of having the app comes from who
          else does and doesn't.
        consequence: |
          The product looks great and gets early design press, but
          the broad availability dilutes the status signal. Brand
          is "well-designed payments app" not "aspirational
          financial product."
        leadsTo: end-C
      - text: Launch with the 750+ gate but no invitation system — anyone with the credit score can sign up.
        points: 9
        pattern: gate-without-velvet-rope
        rationale: |
          Half the move. The credit-score gate creates the right
          population filter, but without a wait-list and visible
          exclusivity, users don't experience the in-out membership
          dynamic that drives the aspirational behavior. They just
          see a "you don't qualify" message and bounce.
        consequence: |
          Signups happen but the conversion-to-evangelist behavior
          is muted. The app has the right users but not the brand
          they would have built.
        leadsTo: end-D
  B-exclusion-followup:
    dimension: product
    prompt: |
      Twelve months in. The aspirational brand has worked — 3M
      premium card holders are using the app, and the wait-list
      mythology is real. Now the question: what's the second
      product? Pick.
    options:
      - text: Launch a rent-payment-via-credit-card product. Massive monthly volume, sticky habit.
        points: 15
        pattern: high-frequency-second-product
        rationale: |
          Strong adjacent product. Rent is the largest monthly
          expense for the urban premium population, and paying via
          credit card means rewards on rent — instantly compelling
          to your existing users. Adds a sticky habit (monthly
          payment) to the brand. Reinforces "premium financial
          product" positioning.
        consequence: |
          Rent payment ships and ~40% of users adopt it within 6
          months. The product becomes habit-forming. ARPU triples.
          A new revenue line opens (rent fees).
        leadsTo: end-B-great
      - text: Launch a loan/credit product. Higher revenue per user.
        points: 9
        pattern: revenue-first-second-product
        rationale: |
          Bigger revenue per user but harder brand fit. Loans
          contradict the aspirational/premium positioning ("you're
          in the top decile" doesn't mix well with "borrow money").
          Adjacent revenue is real but the brand cost is significant.
        consequence: |
          Loan product ships. Revenue grows but a meaningful slice
          of users perceive the app as "trying to push debt." NPS
          softens. Brand sentiment dilutes.
        leadsTo: end-B-mixed
      - text: Launch a luxury concierge / travel product. Pure status play.
        points: 12
        pattern: brand-extension
        rationale: |
          Brand-aligned but operationally heavy. A luxury concierge
          aligns perfectly with the aspirational positioning, but
          requires operational complexity (travel partnerships,
          customer support, fulfillment) that's far from the
          fintech core. Risk of distraction is real.
        consequence: |
          The product launches but operations are messy. Users love
          the idea, complain about the execution. Brand stays
          intact, growth is slower than rent-payment would have
          been.
        leadsTo: end-B-good
  end-A:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      Broad launch + commodity competition was a money pit. The
      brand never escaped "another payments app" framing. Series B
      came at a flat valuation on the substantial burn.
  end-B-great:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      The exclusivity-plus-rent-product combination became the
      textbook on aspirational financial brands. Valuation hit
      $6B+, the brand became cultural shorthand for premium
      financial behavior in urban India.
  end-B-mixed:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      The loan product diluted the brand without compounding the
      revenue meaningfully. The company recovered eventually but
      the brand pristine-ness took a hit.
  end-B-good:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      The concierge play worked brand-wise but slowly. Operations
      caught up over 18 months. The brand stayed aspirational; the
      revenue grew steadily but slower.
  end-C:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      Beautiful but not aspirational. The product won design awards
      but never became a status object. Growth was decent but
      flat compared to the exclusion scenario.
  end-D:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      The right users joined but without the wait-list mythology,
      the brand never compounded. The credit-score gate became
      a friction, not a feature.

## What actually happened

This drill is based on **CRED's launch in 2018**. Kunal Shah launched
CRED as an invitation-only credit-card payment app gated to users
with CIBIL credit scores above 750 — roughly the top 5% of credit
holders in India.

The exclusivity was the entire wedge. The product itself was
relatively simple (pay your credit-card bills, get points, redeem
for rewards) but the brand became aspirational instantly. People
posted screenshots of their CRED interface like trophies. Being
"in CRED" became cultural shorthand for being in the financial
elite of urban India.

Later product expansions (RentPay, House of CRED, CRED Mint) all
extended the aspirational brand. By 2022, CRED reached a **$6.4B
valuation** and became one of the most-talked-about Indian
fintech brands of the decade.

The principle: in commoditizing markets, exclusion isn't unfair —
it's the only viable form of differentiation. Brand built on who's
NOT in is dramatically more defensible than brand built on
features anyone can copy.
