  When the discovery channel changes — search to social, social to
  algorithmic feed, algorithmic to AI search — the companies that
  rebuild their content for the new channel within 12 months win
  asymmetrically. The companies that wait for the channel to settle
  miss the compounding window.
intro: |
  You are the head of marketing at a B2B SaaS company. Organic search
  drives 40% of your pipeline. In Q2 2026, two of your top 10
  keywords dropped from page 1 of Google to "AI Overview included" —
  Google now answers the query directly with an LLM-generated summary,
  and your traffic on those keywords is down 35%. Your CEO is asking
  what's happening.

  Meanwhile, you've noticed ~8% of inbound demos in the last two
  months mention they "found us through ChatGPT" or "Claude
  recommended you." That signal is real but small. Your team wants
  to know how to think about this shift.
nodes:
  start:
    dimension: business
    prompt: |
      Search traffic is down 35% on key terms. AI search is real but
      small. Pick the strategy.
    options:
      - text: "Double down on SEO. Hire more SEO content writers, target more keywords."
        points: 1
        pattern: defending-the-shrinking-channel
        rationale: |
          Misreads the trend. Google AI Overviews aren't a temporary
          dip in your specific keywords — they're a permanent
          restructuring of how the discovery channel works. Hiring
          to capture more of a shrinking channel optimizes the
          wrong axis. The channel that needs investment is the one
          growing (AI search), not the one being absorbed by AI.
        consequence: |
          Q3 SEO investment doubles. Traffic on AI-Overview-affected
          keywords keeps declining. Net pipeline drops 25% by Q4.
        leadsTo: end-A
      - text: "Rebuild content for AI search (GEO/AEO). Structured data, citation-ready formatting, llms.txt, definitive-answer pages."
        points: 5
        pattern: rebuild-for-new-channel
        rationale: |
          Right response to a channel shift. AI search systems
          (Perplexity, ChatGPT search, Google AI Overviews, Claude
          search) preferentially cite content that's structured
          for extraction — clear definitions, comparison tables,
          authoritative authorship signals, FAQ schema, llms.txt
          files declaring content access. Rebuilding your content
          for these signals positions you to be cited as the source
          when AI answers user queries — which is the new "page 1
          of Google."
        consequence: |
          You rebuild ~30 high-value pages over 8 weeks. By Q4, ChatGPT
          and Claude cite your content for ~12 high-intent queries.
          AI-driven demo inbound grows from 8% to 22% of pipeline.
        leadsTo: B-rebuild-followup
      - text: "Pivot to LinkedIn + community channels. Reduce dependency on search entirely."
        points: 3
        pattern: pivot-to-different-channel
        rationale: |
          Defensible diversification, less precise than rebuilding
          for AI search. LinkedIn + community is real but it's a
          different motion (engagement-driven, time-intensive) than
          search (intent-driven, scalable). Worth doing in addition
          to GEO/AEO, but as a substitute it gives up the highest-
          intent traffic channel.
        consequence: |
          LinkedIn pipeline grows ~25%. Search-driven pipeline
          keeps shrinking. Net pipeline flat — you replaced one
          channel with another but missed the channel that
          would have compounded.
        leadsTo: end-C
      - text: "Run paid ads to compensate for lost organic. Pay for the traffic the AI Overviews stole."
        points: 2
        pattern: pay-for-shrinking-channel
        rationale: |
          The worst combination — paying for what used to be free
          on a channel that's being restructured. Paid ads on
          AI-Overview-affected keywords have higher CPCs (because
          fewer impressions go to ads when AI answers the query
          directly) and lower CTRs. You'd be paying premium prices
          for declining attention.
        consequence: |
          Paid CAC jumps 60%. Pipeline stabilizes but at a much
          worse unit economics profile. The board notices.
        leadsTo: end-D
  B-rebuild-followup:
    dimension: product
    prompt: |
      You've rebuilt 30 pages. AI search cites you. The next question:
      should you publish a public dataset/benchmark/study that
      becomes a citation magnet?
    options:
      - text: "Yes — publish an annual industry benchmark. Free, well-formatted, with downloadable data."
        points: 5
        pattern: citation-magnet
        rationale: |
          Asymmetric long-term play. A well-executed industry
          benchmark gets cited by every AI search query about
          your category for years. The cost (one-time research +
          publication) is far lower than the SEO-content-volume
          alternative, and the citations compound across every AI
          model that comes online over the next decade.
        consequence: |
          The benchmark publishes in October. Within 90 days it's
          cited by Perplexity, ChatGPT, and Claude for the top 8
          queries in your category. AI-driven demo inbound jumps
          to 40% of pipeline by EOY.
        leadsTo: end-B-great
      - text: "Stick to the page rebuild. Don't over-invest in a single piece."
        points: 3
        pattern: incremental-content
        rationale: |
          Defensible discipline. Marginal new pages add value but
          they don't compound the way a definitive benchmark does.
          You'd get steady gains without the breakout citation
          asset that an annual benchmark provides.
        consequence: |
          AI-driven inbound stays at ~22%. Steady growth, no
          breakout moment.
        leadsTo: end-B-good
  end-A:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      Doubling down on SEO defended a shrinking channel. Pipeline
      kept dropping. By Q1 next year, you eventually pivoted to
      GEO/AEO — 12 months later than competitors who saw the
      shift sooner.
  end-B-great:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      The benchmark became the citation moat. Your category's AI
      search results lead with your data. Pipeline grew 80%
      year-over-year through AI-driven inbound. The marketing
      function became the most efficient growth lever in the
      company.
  end-B-good:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      Steady gains on AI search but no compounding moment. The
      strategy worked but slower than the benchmark scenario.
  end-C:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      LinkedIn replaced search but didn't compound. The AI search
      window passed; competitors who rebuilt for it captured
      sustained citation revenue you missed.
  end-D:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      The paid-ads detour delivered short-term metrics on a
      worse CAC structure. Board pressure mounted; you eventually
      pivoted to GEO/AEO at year-end after burning a quarter on
      paid.

## What's at stake here

The discovery channel shifted in 2024-2026 from search-engine-
optimization (SEO) to **generative engine optimization (GEO)** and
**answer engine optimization (AEO)**. The companies that rebuilt
their content for AI search citation captured a compounding moat;
the companies that defended classic SEO watched their organic
traffic permanently decline.

The key formatting changes that AI search rewards: structured data
markup, citation-ready definitions and comparisons, FAQ schema,
llms.txt files declaring content access policies, author E-E-A-T
signals (named bylines, credentials, citation links), and
benchmarks/datasets that become reusable references.
