principle: |
  Autonomy is a product decision, not a capability decision. Just
  because your agent CAN take an action doesn't mean it should. The
  most-trusted agents are the ones that ask permission for the
  things users haven't yet learned to trust them with.
intro: |
  You are the lead PM on an AI agent product. Your agent reads the
  user's email, calendar, and CRM, and is designed to help busy
  founders manage their day. It already drafts reply emails (user
  reviews them before send) and books calendar holds (auto-confirmed
  if the slot is free).

  Engineering just shipped an internal demo of "Autonomous Mode" —
  the agent can now send the emails it drafts and confirm meetings
  without user review, with a 96% accuracy rate (4% of actions are
  later corrected by users). The CEO loves it. The founding designer
  is skeptical. You have a launch decision to make in 7 days for the
  v3.0 release.
nodes:
  start:
    dimension: product
    prompt: |
      Should Autonomous Mode ship in v3.0, and if so, how?
    options:
      - text: "Ship autonomous mode default-on. 96% accuracy is better than humans at email triage."
        points: 1
        pattern: accuracy-over-trust
        rationale: |
          The capability-first instinct. 96% sounds high but at the
          volume of an actual founder's inbox (200+ emails/day),
          4% errors = 8 wrong sends per day. Every wrong send is a
          trust-destroying event. Users don't average their
          experience; they remember the worst one.
        consequence: |
          Week one of launch: a wrong-send goes viral on Twitter
          ("AI agent CC'd my entire board on my therapy bill").
          You spend Q3 rebuilding trust the product just destroyed.
        leadsTo: end-A
      - text: "Ship autonomous mode default-off. User has to opt in per action category (email send, meeting confirm, etc.)"
        points: 5
        pattern: opt-in-per-category
        rationale: |
          The trust-staircase approach. Users earn confidence in each
          category separately, opt in when they're ready, and the
          agent's behavior matches their tolerance. Lower initial
          adoption but vastly higher long-term retention because
          every action that fires has been pre-approved at the
          category level.
        consequence: |
          Adoption is slower than the CEO hoped, but the users who
          enable autonomy in any category report dramatically
          higher satisfaction. Net retention up 25%.
        leadsTo: B-optin-followup
      - text: "Hide autonomous mode behind an Advanced settings menu. Don't market it."
        points: 3
        pattern: hide-the-power
        rationale: |
          The risk-averse middle ground. Power users find it, casual
          users never trigger it. Reduces blast radius of errors but
          also caps the upside — the feature you build never gets
          adopted enough to compound.
        consequence: |
          ~3% of users discover autonomous mode. Those users love it.
          Marketing-wise the feature is invisible. The CEO is
          frustrated that you "buried" the launch.
        leadsTo: end-C
      - text: "Ship autonomous mode but require a per-action confirmation toast that lets the user cancel within 10 seconds."
        points: 4
        pattern: confirmation-without-friction
        rationale: |
          Clever middle ground — autonomous in spirit, reversible in
          practice. The 10-second cancel window catches the 4% of
          errors before they become trust-destroying events. The
          tradeoff: still feels like a confirmation step, which
          erodes the "autonomous" framing.
        consequence: |
          Adoption is decent. Trust holds. Some users complain that
          it's not really autonomous; others love the safety net.
          Mixed marketing story.
        leadsTo: end-D
  B-optin-followup:
    dimension: business
    prompt: |
      Three months post-launch. ~30% of users have opted into at
      least one autonomous category. Renewal rate is up 25%. The CEO
      now wants to push a "full autonomy" tier as a paid upgrade —
      $50/month on top of the base $20. Pick the model.
    options:
      - text: "Yes — full autonomy is a paid tier. Justifies the price with the trust dividend."
        points: 5
        pattern: paid-trust-tier
        rationale: |
          Aligned incentives. Users who pay for full autonomy are
          self-selecting as ready for it, and the higher price
          funds the safety infrastructure (post-action audits,
          insurance, faster support). Pricing also signals that
          full autonomy is a premium responsibility, not a default.
        consequence: |
          ~8% of users upgrade to the $50 tier. ARR grows
          meaningfully. Customer support load doesn't spike because
          the upgraders are exactly the cohort ready for autonomy.
        leadsTo: end-B-great
      - text: "No — make all autonomy categories free. Compete on the experience, not the gate."
        points: 3
        pattern: free-tier-trust
        rationale: |
          Defensible — autonomy isn't a feature, it's the product.
          Gating it might feel mercenary. The tradeoff: you give
          up a meaningful revenue lever and the signaling that
          paid users self-select better.
        consequence: |
          Retention is fine, conversion is fine, but ARPU plateaus
          at the lower tier. Net revenue growth slower than the
          paid-tier scenario.
        leadsTo: end-B-mediocre
  end-A:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      The trust failure compounded for months. By the time you
      shipped the opt-in version, two competitors had built better
      brands on safety. You eventually recovered but lost 12
      months of category leadership.
  end-B-great:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      The opt-in plus paid-tier model became the textbook for
      agent products. By year 2 you were the default AI agent for
      founders, and the "trust staircase" model was copied by
      every AI agent company that followed.
  end-B-mediocre:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      The product retained well but the pricing left revenue on the
      table. You eventually added a paid tier in v4 but earlier
      framing would have made it easier.
  end-C:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      Hidden autonomy never compounded. You shipped a product that
      could do more than users knew, and the marketing story stayed
      "AI assistant" instead of "AI agent." Category eventually
      taken by louder competitors.
  end-D:
    isOutcome: true
    summary: |
      The 10-second confirmation worked technically. The marketing
      story was muddled — partially autonomous products have always
      struggled to position. The product worked; the brand never
      sharpened.

## What's at stake here

Every agent product is making this exact call right now. The
companies treating autonomy as a binary capability switch are
failing on trust. The companies treating it as a **trust staircase
the user climbs at their own pace** are compounding retention.

The deeper principle from the field: **the cost of one wrong
autonomous action is asymmetric to the benefit of a thousand right
ones.** Agent design has to optimize for the wrong-action case
because that's the case users remember.
