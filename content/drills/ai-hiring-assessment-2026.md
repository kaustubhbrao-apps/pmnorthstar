  Assessment tools optimize for the easy signal, not the predictive
  one. A test that filters for "can solve this problem" rarely
  predicts "will be effective in this role." The best hiring loops
  use assessments as one input among many, not as the gate.
intro: |
  You are the VP of Engineering at a growth-stage company. Hiring
  pace has accelerated — 30+ open engineering roles, ~500 applicants
  per role. Your recruiting team is overwhelmed, and senior
  engineers are spending 10+ hours/week in interview loops.

  A vendor has pitched you their AI hiring assessment platform: every
  applicant takes a 60-minute structured exercise (coding, system
  design, behavioral), the AI scores and ranks them, and your team
  only interviews the top 10%. Promised: 80% reduction in interview
  hours, "objective" candidate ranking.

  Your head of recruiting is enthusiastic. Your two most senior
  engineers are skeptical. You have to decide before the next
  hiring quarter starts.

  start:
    dimension: founder
    prompt: |
      Pick the move.
    options:
      - text: Roll out the AI assessment as the primary screening filter. Top 10% only get to humans.
        points: 1
        pattern: assessment-as-gate
        rationale: |
          Optimizes for recruiter hours at the cost of hiring
          quality. AI assessments are good at evaluating the
          *kind* of work the test resembles (LeetCode-style
          coding, structured system design) but poor at the
          actual work of engineering at your company (ambiguous
          requirements, judgment calls, communication, debugging
          legacy systems). Filtering aggressively on the AI score
          eliminates many of your best candidates — the ones whose
          skills don't lend themselves to 60-minute structured
          tests.
        consequence: |
          Interview hours drop ~75%. Six months in, hiring
          quality has visibly declined. Senior engineers are
          complaining that recent hires can solve algorithm
          puzzles but struggle with the actual work. Attrition
          among new hires is up 40%.
        leadsTo: end-A
      - text: Use the assessment as one signal among many. Top 30% advance; humans review the borderline cases.
        points: 5
        pattern: assessment-as-input-not-gate
        rationale: |
          Right balance. The assessment gives you efficiency on the
          obvious "yes" and "no" cases while keeping human
          judgment on the ambiguous middle — where most of the
          actual hiring quality lives. The 30% threshold is wider
          than the 10% but still significantly reduces the
          interview load. Treats the AI score as one input
          to a multi-signal decision, not as the decision itself.
        consequence: |
          Interview hours drop ~50%. Hiring quality stays steady
          or improves slightly because senior engineers can
          spend more time on the candidates worth deep
          evaluation.
        leadsTo: B-balanced-followup
      - text: Skip the AI assessment. Add more structured rubrics to the existing human interview loop instead.
        points: 3
        pattern: improve-the-humans
        rationale: |
          Defensible. The real problem is interview loop quality,
          not interview loop volume. Better rubrics, structured
          scoring, and interviewer training improve hiring
          outcomes without introducing the AI assessment's
          failure modes. Cost: still 10+ hours/week per senior
          engineer, no reduction in operational burden.
        consequence: |
          Hiring quality improves measurably. Interview load
          stays high. Senior engineers burn out at ~Q3 from the
          sustained interview hours.
        leadsTo: end-C
      - text: Use the assessment to identify *bottom* 30% to reject, but interview the rest. Invert the filter.
        points: 4
        pattern: filter-out-not-in
        rationale: |
          Clever inversion. AI assessments are most reliable at
          identifying clear "no" candidates (someone who can't
          write basic code) than at ranking competent candidates
          1-100. By only using the AI to filter out the clearly
          unqualified, you preserve human judgment on the
          decision space that matters most. Less efficiency gain
          than the gate approach but lower risk of bad filtering.
        consequence: |
          Interview hours drop ~30%. Hiring quality holds. The
          AI vendor isn't thrilled (you're not using their
          ranking) but the system works.
        leadsTo: end-D
  B-balanced-followup:
    dimension: product
    prompt: |
      Six months in, the balanced approach is working. The AI vendor
      offers a "Pro tier" with bias-auditing tools and EEOC
      compliance reports. ~$30K/year. They also offer custom
      assessments tailored to your company's specific roles —
      another $50K. Pick.
    options:
      - text: Buy both. Compliance + custom assessments worth the investment.
        points: 5
        pattern: invest-in-quality-of-tool
        rationale: |
          Right call for a growth-stage company hiring at scale.
          Bias auditing protects you legally and ethically; custom
          assessments make the AI signal more relevant to your
          actual roles. The cost ($80K) is small relative to the
          downside of bad hires or compliance issues.
        consequence: |
          Compliance reports clean. Custom assessments improve
          signal quality. Hiring loop becomes one of the better
          parts of the company.
        leadsTo: end-B-great
      - text: Buy the bias-auditing tier only. Stick with off-the-shelf assessments.
        points: 4
        pattern: compliance-without-customization
        rationale: |
          Defensible mid-ground. Compliance is the higher-stakes
          investment; custom assessments are nice-to-have. You're
          protected legally without paying for the extra
          customization.
        consequence: |
          Compliance solid. Signal quality is good but not
          optimal. Steady hiring performance.
        leadsTo: end-B-good
      - text: Skip both. The current setup is fine.
        points: 2
        pattern: skip-the-compliance-layer
        rationale: |
          Risk-blind. Hiring tools without bias auditing have been
          challenged in court repeatedly (Workday, HireVue,
          Amazon). The $30K is insurance against a problem that's
          increasingly common in employment law for AI-assisted
          hiring.
        consequence: |
          A discrimination complaint is filed 14 months later
          alleging the AI assessment disadvantaged a protected
          class. Legal costs and remediation dwarf the $30K you
          saved.
        leadsTo: end-B-bad
  end-A:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      Aggressive filtering optimized for the wrong thing. Hiring
      quality declined; new-hire attrition spiked. You eventually
      rolled back to a balanced approach 18 months in, after
      losing a quarter of the new cohort.
  end-B-great:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      Balanced approach + compliance + custom assessments produced
      the best hiring outcomes in the company's history. The
      hiring loop became a competitive advantage; engineers
      bragged about it.
  end-B-good:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      Solid outcome. Hiring works, compliance is clean, but the
      signal quality isn't optimal. Steady not breakout.
  end-B-bad:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      The discrimination complaint resulted in a $1.2M settlement
      and required public remediation. The $30K compliance tier
      would have caught the issue early.
  end-C:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      Better humans + worse tools. Hiring quality is excellent but
      senior engineers are burning out from interview load. By
      Q4, two senior engineers leave citing the interview burden.
  end-D:
    isOutcome: true
    prompt: |
      The filter-out approach worked. Interview load reduced
      meaningfully, hiring quality preserved. Slightly less
      efficiency than the gate approach but dramatically lower
      risk of bad filtering.

## What's at stake here

AI hiring assessments are reshaping how companies screen at scale.
The companies treating them as **gates** are systematically losing
the candidates whose strengths don't match the assessment format
(creative problem-solvers, deep specialists, candidates with
non-traditional backgrounds). The companies treating them as
**inputs** — one signal among many — are getting the efficiency
gains without sacrificing hiring quality.

The deeper pattern: any assessment tool optimizes for the *easy*
signal (objectively measurable performance on a structured task),
not the *predictive* signal (whether someone will be effective
in your specific company doing your specific work). Hiring is
multi-signal; treating it as single-signal is the failure mode.

This is also the lane SimulateIt itself will eventually fit —
**as one input among many in hiring assessment, never as the gate.**
