              <p>
                northstar is a free, curated library of books, case studies,
                and playlists. We collect the bare minimum needed to make the
                site work, never sell anything to anyone, and you can read
                everything here without an account.
              </p>
            </Block>

            <Block title="What we collect">
              <p>
                If you create an account: your email, your chosen display
                name, and a hashed password. We use this to let you save and
                like resources across devices, and to email you password
                resets.
              </p>

                If you subscribe to the newsletter via the embedded form:
                that signup goes directly to Substack, not to us. Substack&apos;s
                privacy policy applies there.

              <p className="mt-3">
                We record the timestamp of your most recent login so we can
                tell, in aggregate, how the site is being used. Nothing
                granular, just a single &ldquo;last seen&rdquo; date per account.

            <Block title="Analytics">
              <p>
                We use Vercel Analytics, which is privacy-preserving by
                design: no cookies, no cross-site tracking, no personally
                identifying data. It tells us aggregate page views and
                anonymous events (e.g. &ldquo;how many people clicked share&rdquo;) so
                we know what content is useful. We can&apos;t tie any of this
                back to you as an individual.
              </p>

            <Block title="Cookies">
              <p>
                A single cookie: an authentication token, set only after you
                log in. It expires automatically and is removed when you log
                out. No marketing cookies, no third-party trackers.

            <Block title="Affiliate links">
              <p>
                Book pages include Amazon affiliate links. If you buy
                something through one, Amazon pays us a small commission at
                no extra cost to you. We don&apos;t share any information about
                you with Amazon, they only know that the click came from
                pmnorthstar.in. Affiliate revenue funds the site so it can
                stay free and paywall-less.

            <Block title="What we never do">
              <p>
                We never sell your data. We never share your email with
                third parties. We don&apos;t run advertising. We don&apos;t use
                fingerprinting or session-replay tools. We don&apos;t share what

                You can delete your account at any time, which removes your
